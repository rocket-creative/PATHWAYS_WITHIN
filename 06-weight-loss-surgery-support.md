## Education and Validation

### Understanding What You're Facing

**Whether or not you've already made the decision** to have weight loss surgery, it's crucial to learn as much as you can about the procedure and its effects before moving forward.

**Weight loss surgery isn't just about physical recovery.** These procedures profoundly affect your mental health, your relationship with food, your body image, your identity, and your emotional wellbeing. Having professional support before, during, and after surgery helps you navigate these complex changes.

### Validating Your Decision

**This is a big decision**, and it makes complete sense that you have questions. You might be asking yourself:
- Am I going to be okay?
- Am I doing the right thing?
- Is the surgery worth the risks?
- Will I be able to maintain the weight loss?
- How will this change my life?
- What if I fail?

**These questions are deeply personal**, and the answers vary for each individual. That's why we encourage you to reach out for professional guidance to explore these questions in a supportive, non judgmental environment.

## Before and After: Comprehensive Support

### Pre Operative Support

**Before surgery, we offer a comprehensive psychological evaluation.** This isn't meant to make you feel inadequate or "crazy"—quite the opposite.

**The goals of pre op evaluation:**
- **Understand your relationship with food** and eating patterns
- **Identify underlying mental health concerns** that could affect success (depression, anxiety, eating disorders, trauma)
- **Assess readiness** for the lifestyle changes required
- **Develop strategies** to support you through recovery
- **Prepare mentally and emotionally** for the changes ahead

**Why this matters:** Nobody wants to undergo major surgery only to regain the weight. Research shows that addressing psychological factors BEFORE surgery significantly improves long term outcomes. This evaluation is a protective measure designed to help you succeed.

**We'll explore:**
- Your history with weight and dieting
- Current eating patterns and triggers
- Emotional eating or food as coping mechanism
- Support systems available to you
- Expectations for surgery and life after
- Mental health history
- Substance use patterns
- Trauma history (especially related to body, food, or abuse)

### Post Operative Support

**After surgery, the real work begins.** Your body has changed, but your brain, emotions, and habits need time to catch up.

**Post op support focuses on:**

**Adapting to Your New Body**
- Processing the rapid physical changes
- Navigating others' reactions to your weight loss
- Dealing with excess skin and body image concerns
- Adjusting to attention (positive or negative) about your appearance

**Creating New Habits**
- Learning to eat mindfully with a smaller stomach
- Recognizing hunger vs. emotional needs
- Developing non food coping strategies
- Building sustainable exercise routines

**Managing Emotions**
- Processing the loss of food as comfort
- Dealing with "transfer addiction" (substituting food with alcohol, shopping, etc.)
- Working through identity changes
- Addressing relationship shifts as you change

**Celebrating Successes**
- Acknowledging non scale victories
- Maintaining motivation through plateaus
- Building confidence in your new capabilities
- Creating a life that supports your new health

## SPOTLIGHT: Weight Loss Surgery Support Group

**For many patients, the most valuable resource we provide is our support group**, where people navigating bariatric surgery can speak freely about their experiences with others who truly understand.

### Who Attends?

**Our groups are incredibly diverse**, including:
- People just beginning to explore surgery as an option
- Those preparing for upcoming procedures
- Recent post op patients navigating early recovery
- People months or years post surgery maintaining their loss
- Those who've experienced regain and are working to get back on track

**This diversity is actually a strength**—newer members learn from those further along, and veterans stay accountable by supporting newcomers.

### What Happens in Group?

**A typical session might include:**
- Sharing wins and challenges from the week
- Discussing specific topics (emotional eating, relationship changes, body image, etc.)
- Problem solving common struggles together
- Celebrating milestones (surgery dates, weight goals, health improvements, etc.)
- Swapping recipes and meal prep strategies
- Sharing exercise tips and accountability
- Processing the emotional journey

**It's a refreshing, honest setting** where you can be completely real about the challenges without judgment. Everyone in that room knows that weight loss surgery isn't the "easy way out"—it's hard work that requires commitment, support, and ongoing effort.

### Why Group Support Matters

**Research consistently shows** that people who participate in support groups after bariatric surgery have:
- Greater long term weight loss success
- Better adherence to dietary guidelines
- Improved mental health outcomes
- Lower rates of weight regain
- Stronger coping skills
- Reduced feelings of isolation

**You're not alone in this journey,** and connecting with others facing the same challenges can make all the difference.

## Common Psychological Challenges After Weight Loss Surgery

### Loss of Food as Comfort

**For many people, food has been a primary coping mechanism** for stress, sadness, boredom, loneliness, or anxiety. After surgery, when you physically can't eat the same way, you lose that coping tool.

**This can feel like grief.** Working with a therapist helps you:
- Identify what emotions you were managing with food
- Develop healthier coping strategies
- Process the loss of that comfort
- Build new ways to nurture yourself

### Identity Changes

**"If I'm not the fat friend, who am I?"**

Weight loss surgery doesn't just change your body—it can fundamentally shift how you see yourself and how others see you. This can be disorienting, exciting, scary, or all of the above.

**We help you:**
- Navigate your evolving identity
- Deal with changing relationship dynamics
- Process others' reactions (support, jealousy, sabotage)
- Build confidence in your new self

### Transfer Addiction

**When food is no longer available as a coping mechanism**, some people unconsciously transfer that addictive behavior to other substances or activities—alcohol, shopping, gambling, or even excessive exercise.

**We watch for warning signs and help you:**
- Recognize transfer addiction early
- Address underlying issues driving addictive patterns
- Build healthy coping mechanisms
- Develop self awareness about your behavior

### Relationship Strain

**Weight loss can strain relationships in unexpected ways:**
- Partners may feel threatened by your changes
- Friends may sabotage (consciously or not) your efforts
- Family dynamics shift as you set new boundaries
- Romantic attention may increase, creating tension

**Therapy helps you navigate these challenges** while maintaining relationships that support your health.
