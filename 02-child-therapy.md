**Subtitle:** Supporting Your Child Through Big Feelings

## You're Not Alone, and Neither Is Your Child

Do you know your child needs support but you're not sure where to begin? You're in the right place.

**There's no single pathway forward when someone small is experiencing something really big**, and we're here to help you navigate your next steps with compassion, expertise, and zero judgment.

Children are not miniature adults. They experience emotions that can feel just as all consuming as what we feel in our adult lives, but they don't yet have the vocabulary, cognitive development, or emotional regulation skills to process those feelings independently. With different developmental stages and unique ways of expressing distress, supporting your little ones through difficult feelings and challenging behaviors can feel overwhelming, scary, or even downright impossible.

**With expert therapists trained across each age and developmental stage, we're here to help you find the pathways back to "possible."**

## No One Got It Wrong. No One Missed a Step.

**Let's start with the most important truth:** Recognizing that your child needs additional support is a powerful, loving parental act—not a sign of failure.

You may be feeling overwhelmed. You may be wondering if you've gotten something wrong, if you missed warning signs, or if this means you're not a good parent. **Please hear this: The need for therapy is not born from failure—not on your part, and not on the part of your child.**

Sometimes we all need help navigating what we're feeling and learning how to process difficult emotions in healthy ways. This is true for adults, and it's doubly true for children whose brains are still developing and who haven't yet built a full toolkit of coping strategies.

**By giving your child access to therapy, you're showing them:**
- Their feelings matter and deserve attention
- Asking for help is a sign of strength, not weakness
- They don't have to figure everything out alone
- You're listening, and you're responding to their needs
- It's safe to feel what they feel

**This is powerful parenting.** You're equipping your child with effective coping skills, developmentally appropriate tools, and a qualified expert to support them through whatever they're facing. You're teaching them that mental health matters and that getting support is normal and healthy.

**Celebrate your child's ability to ask for help (whether they asked directly or you recognized the need) by responding with compassion and action.**

## Common Reasons Parents Seek Therapy for Their Child

Children come to therapy for many reasons, and all of them are valid. You might be seeking support because your child is experiencing:

**Behavioral Challenges**
- Aggressive outbursts or violent behavior
- Difficulty following rules at home or school
- Defiance or oppositional behavior
- Impulsivity or hyperactivity
- Withdrawal or refusing to participate in activities they once enjoyed

**Emotional Struggles**
- Excessive worry or anxiety (separation anxiety, social anxiety, generalized worry)
- Persistent sadness or signs of depression
- Intense fears or phobias
- Difficulty managing anger
- Emotional outbursts that seem disproportionate to situations

**Life Transitions and Changes**
- Divorce or separation of parents
- Death of a loved one (including pets)
- Moving to a new home or changing schools
- Birth of a sibling
- Parent's new relationship or blended family dynamics

**Trauma and Difficult Experiences**
- Witnessing or experiencing violence
- Abuse (physical, emotional, or sexual)
- Bullying (in person or online)
- Accidents or medical trauma
- Natural disasters or frightening events

**Social Challenges**
- Difficulty making or keeping friends
- Social withdrawal or isolation
- Being bullied or bullying others
- Struggles with social skills

**Academic Concerns**
- School refusal or extreme resistance to going to school
- Difficulty concentrating
- Sudden drop in academic performance
- Learning challenges impacting self esteem

**Developmental Concerns**
- Delays in emotional or social development

- ADHD coping strategies
- Difficulty with transitions between activities

**Physical Symptoms Without Medical Cause**
- Frequent stomachaches or headaches (when medical causes have been ruled out)
- Sleep problems or nightmares

- Regression (bedwetting, baby talk, etc.)

**You don't need to have a diagnosis or be certain something is "wrong enough" to seek therapy.** If you're worried, that's enough reason to reach out.

## Play Therapy: How Children Heal

### What is Play Therapy?

**Play therapy is the primary therapeutic approach we use with children**, typically those in middle developmental stages from ages 3 to around 12. While "play therapy" might sound casual, it's a highly specialized, evidence based form of psychotherapy specifically designed for how children's minds work.

**The fundamental insight:** Children process the world through play. It's their natural language, their primary way of exploring emotions, working through experiences, and making sense of what's happening around them.

### Why Play Instead of Talk?

**Adults primarily communicate through words.** We can sit down and have a conversation about our feelings, describe complex emotions, trace patterns back to their roots, and articulate what we need. This is why traditional talk therapy works well for adults.

**Children, especially younger ones, haven't developed these verbal and analytical skills yet.** If you ask a five year old, "How do you feel about your parents' divorce?" they probably can't articulate the complex mix of confusion, fear, sadness, anger, guilt, and powerlessness they're experiencing. They might say "I don't know" or "fine" or change the subject entirely—not because they're being difficult, but because they genuinely can't access and verbalize these feelings.

**But if you watch that same child play, you'll see their inner world unfold.** They might:
- Crash toy cars together violently (expressing anger or chaos)
- Have doll families separate and come back together repeatedly (processing the divorce)
- Build elaborate protective forts (seeking safety and control)
- Act out rescue scenarios (wishing someone would save them)
- Destroy what they've built (expressing powerlessness or anger)

**Play therapy works by bridging the gap between how adults communicate and how children do.** By bringing play to the forefront of navigating complex emotional experiences, we can not only support but actively help children feel their feelings in a way that makes sense for them.

### How Play Therapy Works

**Children process the world through play—good or bad, happy or traumatic.** Their toys and imaginations represent (either literally or symbolically) the shape and feeling of the world around them. A stuffed animal might represent the child themselves, a parent, or safety. A dollhouse might represent their home life. Building blocks might represent their need for control or their fear of things falling apart.

**In play therapy, we join the child in their world through their play.** We get down on the floor with them. We enter their imaginative space. We follow their lead rather than directing or teaching. As we play and engage with the world at their level, they often become less guarded and create space for us to bridge the gap in communication styles as they act out their inner emotions and experiences in real time.

**This isn't random playing—it's carefully guided therapeutic work.** Our therapists are trained to:

**Observe patterns** - What themes keep appearing in play? What gets avoided? What's repeated?

**Provide a safe container** - The playroom becomes a space where any feeling is acceptable, where the child is in control (within safe limits), and where nothing they express will be judged or punished.

**Reflect and validate** - "I notice the mommy doll and daddy doll are fighting a lot today." "It seems like the superhero is trying really hard to protect everyone but keeps getting hurt."

**Introduce healing narratives** - Gently offering new possibilities through play. "I wonder if the superhero could ask for help?" "What if someone helped the scared puppy feel safe?"

**Build skills through play** - Teaching emotional regulation, problem solving, and coping strategies in ways that feel natural and fun rather than like "lessons."

### Individualized, Responsive Therapy

**Each therapist has a unique way of engaging with a child's world, and each child requires a different combination of approaches.** Through ongoing observation and reassessment, your child's therapeutic plan becomes a living document that responds to their evolving needs.

**Play therapy is tailored to:**
- The specific child and their personality
- The experiences they've had
- The way they're feeling in that particular moment
- Their developmental stage
- Their individual strengths and challenges

**Healing and skill building take place** through a treatment plan developed from what the therapist learns about your child and builds upon how they can best support the child through whatever variables may arise.

**Progress may look slow, or it may grow by leaps and bounds quite quickly—it varies tremendously.** Some children process quickly and develop new coping skills within weeks. Others need months or even years to work through complex trauma or deeply ingrained patterns. Both timelines are normal and valid.

### What Play Therapy Addresses

Play therapy is remarkably effective for:
- Processing trauma and difficult experiences
- Developing emotional regulation skills
- Building self esteem and confidence
- Working through grief and loss
- Addressing anxiety and fears
- Improving social skills
- Managing anger and aggression
- Coping with life transitions
- Healing from abuse or neglect
- Addressing behavioral challenges

## Privacy and Parent Engagement: Finding the Balance

At Pathways Within, we recognize that effective therapy for children involves both respecting their need for privacy AND actively engaging parents in the therapeutic process. This can feel like a delicate balance, but it's essential.

### Child Privacy: Why It Matters

**Confidentiality is a cornerstone of effective therapy—even for children.** When children feel their privacy is respected, they're more likely to open up, engage authentically in the therapeutic process, and trust their therapist enough to explore difficult feelings.

**Our commitment:**
- What happens in the playroom generally stays in the playroom
- We don't report every detail of sessions to parents
- Children develop a trusting relationship where they feel safe being fully themselves
- Their thoughts, feelings, and play are honored as private unless safety is a concern

**The exception:** We are required to share information when there are concerns about the child's safety or the safety of others. This includes:
- Thoughts of self harm or suicide
- Abuse or neglect (we're mandated reporters)
- Credible threats to harm others
- Any situation where a child's wellbeing is at immediate risk

**Outside these safety exceptions, your child's therapy is their private space.**

### Parent Engagement: Why It's Essential

**While respecting a child's privacy, we also believe deeply in the importance of parental involvement.** Here's why: Children live in a system (their family), and lasting change requires shifts in that system. The most effective therapy happens when parents are partners in the process.

**How we engage parents:**

**Regular communication** - We schedule periodic check ins with parents (without the child present) to discuss overall progress, themes we're noticing, and strategies to support your child at home.

**Collaboration on goals** - We work with you to identify what success looks like for your family and adjust our approach accordingly.

**Parent guidance** - We provide concrete strategies you can use at home to reinforce what your child is learning in therapy.

**Education** - We help you understand your child's challenges from a developmental and psychological perspective so you can respond with more compassion and effectiveness.

**Support for you** - Parenting a child who's struggling is hard. We offer support and validation for what you're experiencing too.

**What we won't do:** We won't give you a play by play of each session or break your child's trust by sharing private details that aren't relevant to their care or safety.

### What This Looks Like in Practice

**During or after most sessions**, you might receive brief updates like:
- "We worked on identifying feelings today—doing great!"
- "I'm noticing some anxiety around school transitions. Let's talk about how to support that at home."
- "Progress is steady. Keep up the consistent bedtime routine we discussed."

**In periodic parent meetings** (monthly or as needed), we might discuss:
- Overall themes and patterns
- Specific challenges to address
- Strategies to try at home
- How to handle difficult situations
- Progress toward goals

**What we generally won't share:**
- Detailed descriptions of play narratives
- Specific things your child said in session
- Private concerns your child shared that don't involve safety

**By balancing confidentiality with active parental involvement, we create a supportive environment that fosters healing and growth for your child while equipping you to be the most effective parent you can be.**

## Common Concerns for Parents of Children in Therapy

### "Will therapy label my child or make them feel 'broken'?"

**Absolutely not—quite the opposite.** Therapy helps children understand that having big feelings and needing support is normal and healthy, not a sign of being broken or defective.

We work hard to frame therapy in age appropriate, empowering ways:
- "This is a place where you can talk about anything"
- "Sometimes all of us need help figuring out big feelings"
- "You're learning skills to help you when things feel hard"

Many children actually feel relieved to have a space dedicated to them and their needs. It validates that what they're experiencing matters.

### "My child won't talk about their feelings. How can therapy help?"

**This is exactly why play therapy exists.** Children don't need to talk about their feelings in order to process them. Through play, art, sand tray work, movement, and other expressive modalities, children communicate and heal without needing to verbalize complex emotions.

Over time, as they develop more comfort and skills, many children do begin to put words to their experiences—but this happens organically, not through pressure.

### "How long will my child need therapy?"

**It depends on many factors:**
- The issue being addressed (recent situational stress vs. complex trauma)
- Your child's age and developmental stage
- The severity and duration of symptoms
- Support systems at home and school
- Your child's innate resilience and coping abilities

**Some children benefit from short term therapy** (8-12 weeks) to develop specific skills or process a particular event. **Others need longer term support** (several months to a year or more) for deeper healing.

**We'll assess progress regularly with you and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.** Therapy ends when your child has met their goals and you feel confident in their ability to navigate challenges independently.

### "What if my child doesn't want to go to therapy?"

**Some resistance is completely normal**, especially at first. Children may resist because:
- They don't understand what therapy is
- They're worried it means something is "wrong" with them
- Change feels scary
- They don't want to talk about hard things
- They're generally resistant to new situations

**How to help:**
- Frame it positively: "We found someone who's really good at helping kids with big feelings"
- Normalize it: "Lots of kids (and adults!) see therapists"
- Give them some control: "You can pick out a toy to bring to your first appointment"
- Don't force confessions: "You don't have to talk about anything you don't want to—this is your time"
- Be patient: Most children warm up after a session or two

**If resistance continues, we can work with that too.** It's part of the therapeutic process.

### "Will my child's school be involved?"

**Only if you want them to be and you provide written consent.** We can't share information with your child's school without your explicit permission.

**That said, collaboration with schools can be very helpful** when:
- Behavioral issues are occurring at school
- Your child needs accommodations (504 plan, IEP)
- Teachers can reinforce strategies we're using in therapy
- School counselors are part of your child's support team

**You always control what information is shared and with whom.**

## What Parents Can Do to Support Their Child in Therapy

**Show up consistently**
- Prioritize therapy appointments and avoid frequent cancellations
- Arrive on time (transitions are easier when not rushed)
- Maintain a consistent schedule (same day/time each week when possible)

**Stay positive about therapy**
- Frame it as a helpful resource, not a punishment
- Speak positively about your child's therapist
- Ask (age appropriately) how therapy went, but don't pressure for details

**Implement strategies at home**
- Try the techniques and approaches your child's therapist suggests
- Maintain consistency between what happens in therapy and what happens at home
- Be patient—new skills take time to develop

**Take care of yourself**
- Attend your own therapy if needed
- Lean on your support system
- Practice self compassion (you're doing your best)

**Communicate with the therapist**
- Share relevant information about changes at home, school, or with health
- Ask questions when you're confused or concerned
- Be honest about what is and isn't working

**Celebrate progress**
- Notice and acknowledge small improvements
- Praise effort, not just outcomes
- Remember that healing isn't linear (setbacks are normal)
