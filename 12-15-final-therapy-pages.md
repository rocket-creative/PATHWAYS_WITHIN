# FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

## We Love Answering Questions!

Here are some of the most common questions we hear. If you're curious about anything else, just reach out—we're always happy to help.

---

### Where are you located?

We have **five locations** across Long Island plus **virtual therapy** available.

**Locations:**
- Garden City: 520 Franklin Ave, Suite L1, Garden City NY 11530
- Port Jefferson: 1227 Main Street, Suite 101, Port Jefferson, NY 11777

Each location has dedicated parking for your convenience.

---

### Do you take insurance?

**Yes!** We're in-network with most major insurance providers in New York.

**Accepted Insurance:**
Aetna, Cigna, Optum, UHC, Oxford, UMR, Oscar, 1199, Meritain, Magnacare, Humana, Medicare, NYSHIP, Student Resource Allied Benefit, ComPsych, VA Community Care Benefits, MVP, Northwell Brighton Health

**Out-of-network options available.**

Once we confirm your benefits, we'll create a therapeutic plan that respects your coverage and any limitations. If your insurance doesn't cover treatment or you're self-pay, we may be able to offer a sliding scale plan.

**We accept:** Cash, major credit cards, HSA and FSA funds

Please reach out to our admissions coordinator to confirm your options.

---

### How often will we meet?

**Initially, we typically meet once a week.** If it's therapeutically necessary, we may meet more often.

We'll continue meeting weekly for as long as our therapeutic relationship feels beneficial to you. As your work evolves, the schedule may change—we remain flexible and responsive to your growth and changing needs.

---

### How long do sessions last?

**Each session is one full hour.**

This is your dedicated time, and we're committed to showing up fully to support the brave work you're doing. In exchange, we ask that you commit to your scheduled weekly time slot (same day and time each week) to optimize your progress with your clinician.

---

### What is your cancellation policy?

**Appointments must be canceled 72 hours in advance.**

There will be a **$75 no-show fee** for appointments canceled within the 72-hour window or missed without notice.

All clients must have a credit card on file through IvyPay (a HIPAA-compliant provider), which can be used for these fees or for co-pays.

**Why this policy?** Your time slot is reserved exclusively for you. Last-minute cancellations prevent someone else from getting help and make it impossible for your therapist to fill that hour.

---

### What happens if I have to miss a session or forget?

**We understand that life happens!**

If you need to cancel or reschedule, we kindly ask for **at least 72 hours notice** when possible. For true emergencies, we work with you.

Sessions canceled with less than 72 hours notice—or missed without notice—may be subject to the cancellation fee. This policy helps us respect the time of both our therapists and clients.

If you have questions or an emergency, don't hesitate to reach out directly to your clinician.

---

### Do you have evening appointments?

**Yes!** We offer appointments outside regular business hours.

With advance scheduling, we can accommodate schedules of every kind. **Appointments available up to 11 PM** with select clinicians.

---

### Do you offer virtual visits?

**Absolutely!** We call it telehealth, and our therapy services can be offered in whatever format you're most comfortable with.

You can:
- Meet with your therapist entirely through our virtual platform
- Switch between telehealth and in-person visits
- Choose what works best for your schedule and preferences

**Before your first virtual visit**, we'll send you a link to get set up on our platform, SimplePractice. It's user-friendly and secure.

---

### Is virtual therapy private?

**Yes, completely.**

SimplePractice is both **HIPAA compliant** and **VeriSign security sealed**. Your privacy is crucial to us, and we take every step to ensure confidentiality in every format—whether in-person or virtual.

---

### How do you incorporate Therapy and Wellness together?

**At Pathways Within, we believe true healing happens when mind and body are supported together.**

Our therapy services focus on emotional insight, personal growth, and mental wellbeing. But we don't stop there. Through our **360º approach to care**, we partner with our sister site **Pathways Within Wellness** to provide a truly holistic experience.

**Together, we support your journey from the inside out**—integrating therapeutic care with restorative wellness services (massage, acupuncture, IV therapy, skin treatments, etc.) to help you feel grounded, renewed, and whole.

When appropriate, your therapy and wellness providers can communicate (with your permission) to create integrated care that addresses your complete wellbeing.

---

### Do you offer discounts or sliding scale fees?

**Yes**, we offer a **limited number of sliding scale spots** based on financial need and availability.

If you're paying out of pocket and have concerns about affordability, we encourage you to speak with us directly. Our goal is to make therapy as accessible as possible, and we're happy to explore options that support your care.

We can't offer reduced fees to everyone, but when possible, we work hard to find solutions.
