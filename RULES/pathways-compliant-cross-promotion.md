# PATHWAYS WITHIN: COMPLIANT CROSS-PROMOTION STRATEGY
## Wellness + Therapy Integration (HIPAA/FTC Compliant)

---

## OVERVIEW

Pathways Within operates two interconnected brands:

**Pathways Within Therapy** (5 locations + telehealth)
- Mental health services under licensed clinical supervision

**Pathways Within Wellness** (2 locations: Massapequa + Garden City)
- Spa and wellness services

**Ownership Disclosure:** Both practices operate under common ownership. This must be disclosed in all cross-promotional materials.

---

## PART 1: COMPLIANT CROSS-PROMOTION PRINCIPLES

### What We CAN Do

1. **General website mentions** of sister practice existing (not targeted to individuals)
2. **Face-to-face mentions** during appointments (provider discretion)
3. **Opt-in marketing** with explicit HIPAA-compliant authorization
4. **Educational content** about mind-body wellness (no outcome claims)
5. **Shared location information** (noting practices share buildings)
6. **Brochure availability** at each location

### What We CANNOT Do

1. ❌ Use client/patient lists for cross-marketing without authorization
2. ❌ Send automated marketing based on visit history
3. ❌ Make claims about treatment outcomes
4. ❌ Imply diagnosis or suggest someone "needs" the other service
5. ❌ Claim services "accelerate," "enhance," or "improve" each other's outcomes
6. ❌ Create "packages" bundling therapy with wellness
7. ❌ Use clinical language to justify commercial cross-sells

### For Therapy Providers

**When appropriate to mention (provider discretion):**
- Client asks about stress relief, relaxation, or physical tension
- Client mentions interest in massage, acupuncture, etc.
- Natural conversation where it's relevant

**Script:**
> "I want to mention that we have a sister practice called Pathways Within 
> Wellness that offers massage and other services. It's completely separate 
> from your therapy and totally optional. Here's their card if you're ever 
> interested."

**Do NOT say:**
- "I think you should try massage, it would help your therapy"
- "Massage can help release what we're working on"
- "Many of my clients find it helps with their anxiety"
- Anything implying clinical benefit or recommendation

### For Wellness Providers

**When appropriate to mention (provider discretion):**
- Client mentions stress, difficult life circumstances, relationship issues
- Client asks about mental health support
- Natural conversation where it's relevant

**Script:**
> "I want to mention that we have a sister practice called Pathways Within 
> Therapy if you're ever interested in that kind of support. It's completely 
> separate from your wellness services. Here's their card."

**Do NOT say:**
- "It sounds like you need therapy"
- "Your tension might be from unresolved trauma"
- "A therapist could help you work through what's causing this"
- Anything implying diagnosis or clinical assessment

## PART 5: PHYSICAL LOCATION CROSS-PROMOTION

- "Pathways Within Therapy | Pathways Within Wellness" at shared locations
- No claims about "integrated care" or "coordinated treatment"
