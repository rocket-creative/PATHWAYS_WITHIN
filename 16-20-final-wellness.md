# HYDRAFACIAL TREATMENTS

## Revolutionary Skin Rejuvenation

**Our HydraFacial experience is a revolutionary skin rejuvenation treatment** that exfoliates, cleanses, and hydrates your skin with immediate, visible results.

**No other facial delivers such dramatic improvements** in skin quality with zero downtime.

---

## What is a HydraFacial?

**HydraFacial is a non-invasive facial treatment** that combines multiple steps into one powerful procedure:
- Deep cleansing
- Exfoliation
- Extraction
- Hydration
- Antioxidant protection

**All in 30-60 minutes.**

**The patented Vortex-Fusion technology** uses a unique spiral tip to simultaneously exfoliate dead skin cells while infusing skin with intensive serums. This creates suction that painlessly dislodges and removes impurities while delivering hydration.

**No other device can do this.**

---

## How HydraFacial Works

### Step 1: Cleanse & Peel

**Deep cleansing and gentle exfoliation** uncover a fresh layer of skin.

**What happens:**
- Dead skin cells are lifted away
- Pores are prepared for extraction
- Surface is primed for serum absorption

**You'll feel:** Gentle suction and light exfoliation (not scratchy or harsh)

---

### Step 2: Extract & Hydrate

**Painless suction removes blackheads and impurities** while simultaneously nourishing with intense moisturizers.

**What happens:**
- Debris is painlessly extracted from pores
- Hydrating serums flood skin
- Pores are cleansed deep within

**You'll see:** Immediate improvement in clarity and glow

---

### Step 3: Fuse & Protect

**Skin is saturated with antioxidants and peptides** to maximize glow and protect.

**What happens:**
- Antioxidants neutralize free radicals
- Peptides support collagen
- Hyaluronic acid deeply hydrates
- Skin is protected from environmental damage

**Results:** Radiant, healthy, glowing skin immediately

---
