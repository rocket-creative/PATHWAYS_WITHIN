## Working with the Energy Body

**Energy work is a holistic practice that works with the body's subtle energy system** to promote healing, balance, and wellbeing. Our certified energy workers offer **Reiki** and **Integrative Energy Therapy (IET)** to help you achieve optimal health and harmony.

**While you can't see energy with your eyes**, most people can feel it—that sense of heaviness when you're stressed, lightness when you're joyful, the "vibe" someone gives off, or the way a space feels calming or agitating.

**Energy work addresses healing at the energetic level**, which then manifests in your physical body, emotions, and mental state.

## Understanding Energy Healing

### What is Energy?

**In energy healing traditions, we work with:**

**The Human Energy Field (Aura)**  
The electromagnetic field that surrounds and interpenetrates your physical body. This field carries information about your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual state.

**Chakras (Energy Centers)**  
Seven main energy centers along the spine that govern different aspects of your physical and emotional health. When chakras are blocked or imbalanced, it affects your wellbeing.

**Meridians**  
Energy pathways through which life force flows (also used in acupuncture).

**When energy flows freely**, you feel vibrant, healthy, balanced, and whole. **When energy is blocked or stagnant**, you may experience physical symptoms, emotional distress, mental fog, or spiritual disconnection.

### How Energy Work Heals

**Energy healing works on the principle** that your body has an innate ability to heal itself when barriers to healing are removed.

**During energy work, the practitioner:**
- Senses areas where energy is blocked or depleted
- Channels universal life force energy through their hands
- Helps clear blocks and restore balanced flow
- Activates your body's natural healing mechanisms

**This allows your system to:**
- Release stored trauma and emotions
- Restore balance and harmony
- Activate self-healing processes
- Reconnect with your authentic self

## Reiki: Universal Life Force Energy

### What is Reiki?

**Reiki is a Japanese healing technique** (developed by Dr. Mikao Usui in the early 1900s) that uses universal life force energy to promote healing and balance in the body.

**The word "Reiki" means:**
- Rei = Universal, spiritual wisdom
- Ki = Life force energy (similar to Chi or Prana)

**During Reiki, the practitioner channels healing energy** through their hands to the client, either with gentle touch or hovering just above the body. This energy goes where it's needed most, supporting your body's natural healing wisdom.

### What Reiki Addresses

**Reiki works on all levels:**

**Physical**
- Chronic pain
- Injury recovery
- Post-surgical healing
- Fatigue and low energy
- Headaches and migraines
- Sleep disturbances

**Emotional**
- Stress and anxiety
- Depression
- Grief and loss
- Emotional overwhelm
- Difficulty processing feelings
- Emotional numbness

**Mental**
- Mental fog or confusion
- Difficulty making decisions
- Obsessive thoughts
- Lack of clarity
- Creative blocks

**Spiritual**
- Feeling disconnected from yourself
- Lack of purpose or meaning
- Spiritual crisis
- Desire for deeper connection

### Benefits of Reiki

**Promotes Deep Relaxation**  
Reiki induces profound relaxation, allowing your nervous system to shift from stress response to healing mode. Many people fall asleep or enter meditative states during sessions.

**Reduces Stress and Anxiety**  
By calming the nervous system and releasing energetic tension, Reiki significantly reduces stress and anxiety levels. Effects often last well beyond the session.

**Supports Emotional Healing**  
Reiki creates a safe space for suppressed emotions to surface and release. Many people experience emotional release (crying, laughing) during or after sessions—this is healing, not distress.

**Enhances Overall Wellbeing**  
Regular Reiki sessions improve energy levels, mood, sleep quality, mental clarity, and overall sense of wellness.

**Can Complement Other Medical Treatments**  
Reiki is increasingly used in hospitals and medical settings to support conventional treatment, reduce side effects, and promote recovery.

**Reiki never interferes with medical treatment**—it only enhances your body's natural healing processes.

## Integrative Energy Therapy (IET)

### What is IET?

**Integrative Energy Therapy** is a form of energy work that combines various healing modalities to address the whole person—mind, body, and spirit.

**IET is particularly powerful for:**
- Releasing cellular memory of trauma
- Clearing suppressed emotions
- Healing ancestral patterns
- Spiritual awakening and growth
- Deep transformational work

**IET works with angelic energy** and focuses specifically on clearing energetic imprints left by traumatic experiences, limiting beliefs, and suppressed emotions.

### The 9 Cellular Memory Areas

**IET targets nine specific areas of the body** where trauma and emotions are commonly stored:

1. **Stress & Fear** - Stored in the adrenal glands
2. **Guilt & Shame** - Stored in the stomach area
3. **Heartache & Betrayal** - Stored in the chest
4. **Resentment & Anger** - Stored in the liver area
5. **Fear & Powerlessness** - Stored in the kidneys
6. **Threat & Survival** - Stored in the colon area
7. **Shock & Trauma** - Stored in the spleen area
8. **Limiting Beliefs** - Stored in the throat area
9. **Sadness & Loss** - Stored in the lungs

**By clearing these stored imprints**, IET allows you to release patterns that have been running your life unconsciously.

### Benefits of IET

**Releases Stored Emotions and Trauma**  
IET excels at helping you release emotions and trauma that have been suppressed or stuck for years, even decades. This includes childhood experiences, past relationships, or events you thought you'd "gotten over."

**Promotes Spiritual Growth**  
Many people experience profound spiritual insights, connection to higher guidance, and clarity about their life purpose through IET.

**Enhances Intuition**  
As energetic blocks clear, many people notice their intuition becoming stronger and more accessible.

**Balances the Energy System**  
IET works with all your chakras and energy centers to restore harmonious flow throughout your entire system.

**Supports Emotional and Physical Healing**  
By addressing root causes at the energetic level, IET often leads to improvement in both emotional wellbeing and physical symptoms.

### What to Expect in an IET Session

**The experience is similar to Reiki, with some differences:**

- **More targeted** - IET practitioners focus on specific cellular memory areas
- **More emotionally intense** - You may experience stronger emotional releases
- **Integration work** - After clearing old imprints, we integrate new supportive energy
- **Angelic connection** - Many people feel a sense of divine presence or guidance

**Sessions typically last 60-90 minutes** due to the depth of work.

## Energy Work Benefits

### Reduce Stress

**Energy work helps release tension and promote deep relaxation**, reducing stress and anxiety at their energetic roots—not just masking symptoms.

**How it works:**
- Calms the nervous system
- Releases energetic holding patterns
- Restores parasympathetic (rest and digest) functioning
- Creates space between stimulus and reaction

---

### Address Energy Blocks

**By identifying and releasing energy blocks**, energy work helps restore the free flow of life force throughout your body.

**Blocks can be created by:**
- Trauma (physical or emotional)

- Limiting beliefs

- Chronic stress
- Disconnection from your authentic self

**When blocks are cleared:**
- Physical symptoms often improve
- Emotions flow more freely
- Mental clarity increases
- You feel more "like yourself"

- Clarity about your path
- Deeper self-understanding
- Access to inner peace

---

### Complements Talk Therapy

**Energy work can be used beautifully alongside talk therapy** to support emotional healing and personal growth.

**Why this combination is powerful:**
- Talk therapy addresses the mind and narrative
- Energy work addresses what's stored in the body and energy field
- Together, they create comprehensive healing

**Many people find that:**
- Emotions they've been processing in therapy release more easily with energy work
- Insights from energy sessions deepen their therapeutic work
- Trauma held in the body can finally release
- They make faster progress using both modalities

**We can coordinate care** between your energy worker and your therapist (with permission) at **Pathways Within Therapy**.
