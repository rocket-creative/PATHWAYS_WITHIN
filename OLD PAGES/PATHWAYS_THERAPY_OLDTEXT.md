individual-therapy
"The shoe that fits one person pinches another; there is no one recipe for living that suits all cases." — Carl Jung
Individual Therapy
Individual therapy is your classic one-on-one counseling. The beauty of individual therapy lies in two main foundations: first, that you are willing to challenge yourself and learn more about the roots of your symptoms and yourself in the process; and second, that you are having a dialogue with a trained professional. The goal of individual therapy is to find greater self-awareness and give you the tools to live a more meaningful life.
Self-Exploration
The Greek philosopher Aristotle said: "Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom." We believe that any form of therapy is a path to knowing yourself better with the final goal of managing any mental health issues you may experience. Some issues that may be coming up for you include anxiety, depression, grief, anger, and low self-esteem. You might be asking yourself: Can therapy really help me? The answer is a resounding yes. Having someone to talk to who is unbiased and non-judgmental can be incredibly helpful on its own. On top of that, add the support and knowledge a skilled therapist brings to the table and you have yourself a winning formula.
Skilled Professionals
Our therapists are trained, licensed, and experienced in different areas of counseling. Each clinician works with special populations based on their expertise and passions. We've been working for years with people of all kinds of backgrounds, and we're confident we have someone in house who can help you with any issues you may be encountering. We look to create a journey for each individual that is as individual as they are. We focus on getting to know you, being with you along the way, and figuring out how best to be of service.
Spotlight: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)
One of the methods we use often is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or CBT. This is a type of therapy that focuses on achieving one or more goals by "rewiring" the brain through paying attention to our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors and the ways that they are connected. In this practice, a therapist works to change the patterns of thinking that may lurk behind the negative symptoms that may have originally brought you in for services. Often, CBT reveals the stark difference between what your brain thinks will happen and what will actually happen. You may find that, for instance, you have a crippling fear of public speaking. Your mind will tell you that it is easier to avoid public speaking in order to avoid the stress and anxiety that comes with the phobia. CBT seeks to remind you however, that avoidance often allows the fear to grow and become unmanageable. To rewire the brain, a therapist will help you identify triggers and problematic thought patterns, and by exploring where they originate, and learning coping skills you will be empowered to challenge those negative thoughts and develop a more positive way of thinking.
FAQs
Why would I want to talk to a therapist?
Therapists are people too! The benefit of talking to a therapist is the training and experience we've collected over the years. Some people prefer to talk to friends about their problems, and we don't discourage that because friends can be a great source of support in difficult times. However, friends are often unable to provide an unbiased and non-judgmental perspective and may not know how to support you in the ways you need it most. Many people thrive on both—friends who love and cherish you and a therapist who can help guide and support you through your mental health journey.
How long do I have to be in therapy?
Therapy is meant to work for you, so that means we accommodate any preferences you may have. The length and frequency of therapy will depend on your goals and the effort you put forth in following through. It's difficult for us to predict how long therapy will be a part of your life, but the important part to focus on is that you get to decide and the process can be as flexible as you need. You can see us for a few months, stop, and start back up again. That's part of the benefit of individual therapy—it's all about you and what works for your life. Of course the more you view therapy as a priority and commit yourself to the process, the quicker you will likely see results.
How confidential is therapy?
Your privacy is a major ethical concern for us. We want you to feel comfortable and therefore we adhere to the guidelines set forth by the American Psychological Association (APA) and HIPAA. Still, there are some limitations. If you express the intent to hurt a child, an elderly person, or yourself, we are required to report some information to relevant authorities. However, aside from these stipulations, what you say within the confines of a therapy session are completely confidential and will remain entirely private.
What happens in a counseling session?
Well, part of that is entirely up to you. We want your session to be yours. It's a space for you to talk about whatever's on your mind. That being said, each clinician may operate in different ways. If you think you'll prefer someone who provides a good amount of structure or practices a specific method of therapeutic intervention, we will make sure to pair you up with the right therapist for you. Once you're paired with a therapist, your first session will be where you'll have the opportunity to work out your specific concerns. In return, we will ask questions as well to get to know you and your situation a bit better. Humans are complicated, and the more time we can spend talking to you, the more we'll be able to get to know you to best help you walk through the concerns that originally brought you in. Usually, your therapist will have some game plan for the session, but we are also flexible to tackle anything that may come up organically in each session. You can think of the role of the therapist like a conductor on a train. Throughout treatment, you and your therapist are faced with several dark tunnels. You decide which tunnel you would like to explore and your therapist drives the train. At any point, if you decide you want to try a different tunnel, you can turn around together and try again.

child-therapy
Therapy for Children on Long Island
Do you know your child needs support but you're not sure where to begin? There's no singular way forward when someone small is experiencing something really big and we're happy to help you navigate your next steps. Children are not miniature adults, yet they often feel emotions as all-consuming as we do in our adult lives. With different developmental stages and expression cues, supporting your little ones through their difficult feelings and challenging behaviors can feel scary or even downright impossible. With expert therapists across each age and stage, we are here to help you find the Pathways back to "possible".
No one got it wrong. No one missed a step.
Recognizing the need for additional support in your child is a powerful parental experience. You may be feeling overwhelmed or as if you've gotten something wrong, but the need for therapy is not borne from failure—not on your part, or the part of your child. Sometimes, we just all need a little help in navigating what we're feeling and how to process that. Giving your children the ability to recognize that need, ask for that support and work through their roadblocks with effective coping skills, developmentally appropriate tools, and a qualified expert to support them is a powerful way to show them you're listening. Celebrate your child's ability to ask for help by responding to their needs. Caring for the big feelings of our littlest loved ones.
Play Therapy on Long Island
Most often used with children in middle developmental stages from ages 3 to around 12, play therapy capitalizes on the ability of abstract informational exchange to help your child engage in emotional processing through a less invasive lens. Play therapy works by bridging the gap between the way adults communicate and the way children do. By bringing play to the forefront of navigating complex emotional experiences, we can not only support but actively help children feel their feelings in a way that makes sense for them.
How it works: Our kids process the world through play. Good or bad, their toys and imaginations represent—either literally or symbolically—the shape and feeling of the world around them. Through play therapy, we join the child in their world through their play. As we play and engage with the world at their level, they may become less guarded and create space for us to bridge the gap in communication styles as they act out their inner emotions and experiences in real-time. Each therapist has a unique way of engaging in a child's world, and each child will require a different combination of those methods. Through observation and re-assessment, the therapeutic plan will be a living document that responds to your child's needs. Play therapy will be tailored to the child, the experiences they've had, and the way they're feeling in that moment. Healing and skill-building will take place with a treatment plan outlined from what the therapist learns and build upon how they can best help the child through any and all variables that may occur. Progress may look slow, or grow by leaps and bounds quite quickly, depending.
Privacy & Parent Engagement in Child Therapy
At Pathways Within, we recognize that effective therapy for children involves both respecting their need for privacy and actively engaging parents in the therapeutic process.
Child Privacy
Confidentiality is a cornerstone of effective therapy. Children are more likely to open up and engage in the therapeutic process when they feel their privacy is respected. Therapists are committed to maintaining this confidentiality, sharing information with parents only when necessary, such as when there are concerns about the child's safety.
Parent Engagement
While respecting a child's privacy, we also believe in the importance of parental involvement. Parents are encouraged to participate in the therapeutic process, collaborating with therapists to support their child's progress. This partnership ensures that therapeutic strategies are reinforced at home and that parents are equipped to assist their child effectively. By balancing confidentiality with active parental involvement, we aim to create a supportive environment that fosters healing and growth for your child.

teen-therapy
Therapy for Teens on Long Island
Do you or your child need someone to talk to but you're not sure where or how to begin? Teens reign supreme in the realm of "I don't want to talk about it" and with good reason. The cognitive and emotional development that takes place in our teen years is profound—moving each of us along our own journey from voiceless to independent within a complicated world that's changing around us. It can be hard to know how to process what you're feeling while you're feeling it, much less putting it into words so someone else can understand. It's not that teens don't want to be understood or feel above relating to their loved ones. They're trying to understand themselves first. We're here to support that effort, not replace or undermine it.
Social Changes: Exposure, Independence, Identity, Influences, Relationships, Responsibility, Values
Emotional Changes: Decision making, Feelings, Moods, Peer response, Perception, Sensitivity, Self-consciousness
A comfortable and safe therapeutic relationship can help make sense of the kaleidoscope of experiences that can make teenhood feel tumultuous.
For Teens →
Are you feeling hopeless, helpless, frustrated, or just overwhelmed? Experiencing something and you're just not sure where to turn or how to process it? We're here for you. Growing up is complicated and no one is going to tell you it's normal or that you're being too "emo" or "angsty". The truth is, you're not. You're going through a lot and there is nothing wrong with asking for help to make sure you can do that safely. Your mental health is important and we value your autonomy in advocating for it and your privacy in talking about the things that matter to you. Be clear, be confident, and don't overthink it. The beauty of your story is that it's going to continue to evolve and your site can evolve with it. Your goal should be to make it feel right for right now. Later will take care of itself. It always does. If you're feeling overwhelmed by the things you're experiencing and fear you may be at risk of harm from yourself or anyone else, please don't wait for an appointment. Call 911 and seek immediate care.
The places we can help
School: School stress is overwhelming. Balancing your academic needs with your independence and developing responsibilities outside of school can be a lot of pressure.
Family: The shape of relationships at home will change and you may be looking to understand how to love your family while celebrating your growing independence.
Social: Friends, peers, social groups, and clubs. It's a lot to try to sort out in figuring out where you fit, where you want to fit, and how to prioritize the people around you.
The experiences we can support
Trauma: If you've been through something that's sticking with you and affecting your ability to process your healing, you are not alone. There are tools out there to support a variety of types of trauma.
Abuse: Have you experienced physical or sexual abuse? After the initial shock of what you've been through, you may be ready to move on but you're not sure how. We want to help you take your life back.
Health: Your whole-self health has an impact on how you experience your day-to-day life. Whether you are struggling with physical, mental, or a combination of health concerns, you deserve to feel empowered.
In therapy, you might:

Talk about what's bothering you because it's easier to feel your feelings one at a time when you don't have to keep them all inside
Learn new things about yourself or the situations you're in so you feel empowered in what's going on and how it might impact you
Practice skills to help you navigate the world around you like mindfulness, self-talk, and breathing tools no one can see you using—or stop you from accessing
Find new skills and strengths to help you feel confident in who you are and what you want to achieve even when things feel hard

At home, you can:

Begin preparing for the growth that will take place as you find a safe space to relax and get support
Practice the skills you're learning with your therapist
Lean on parents and teachers for support
Care for yourself by staying hydrated, eating well, and moving your body
Care for your mind with empowering self-talk, and open dialogue with someone you trust about how you're feeling

For Parents →
Therapy can help find the pathways toward navigating the immense pressures of a constantly changing social and emotional sphere in this transitional time. Whether your teen has experienced something that is beyond your expertise as a parent or is having difficulty processing the changes they're going through, they deserve support. Offering an empathetic, judgment-free space is a wonderful way to engage your teens and open the door for hard conversations. But what happens when we're having those hard conversations and you're not sure what to do with what you learn? Therapeutic support for your teens is a tool to support those conversations, not a replacement for having them. It's just as much a parenting tool for you as it is for them.

couples-therapy
"Being the 'best you can be' is really only possible when you are deeply connected to another. Splendid isolation is for planets, not people." — Dr. Sue Johnson
Couples Therapy
Relationships can be difficult to maintain, especially as the years go by and each person changes in unforeseen ways. A break in communication can often lead to other problems that plague modern marriages, and therapy can be a powerful way to tease out the underlying issues in order to build stronger connections with your partner.
Do you find yourself wondering why you haven't found the love you want in your relationships? Or why it seems like love fades the longer you've been together? Do you believe no matter what you say or do for your significant other, it's never the "right thing" or "good enough"? Do you find yourself in the aftermath of a betrayal in one way or another? These are common feelings to have when you have been in a long-term relationship but couples therapy can help.
Couples Therapy in a Nutshell
In a long partnership, people tend to drift apart. It's the natural ebb and flow of relationships, and there's nothing inherently wrong in your relationship if you feel this way. The trick is being able to pull yourself back together and rediscover what drew you to your partner in the first place. To some couples, it might feel uncomfortable to air out your "dirty laundry" in front of another person. We want you to know that's not how it feels from our side. We are there simply to help communication flow easily, to serve as a middle ground for each partner. The connection is already there—we're just there to remind you what it is and how to tap into it.
Comfort is Key
One of the most important parts of couples therapy is feeling comfortable, both with the idea of attending therapy and with the therapist as well. Usually, one partner is much more convinced about the wonders of therapy than the other, and in these cases, it's important to show them how grateful you are that they are giving therapy a try. It's important to know that your therapist is not going to take sides regarding whatever conflict you may bring in, no matter their gender or personal history. The role of the therapist is not to claim one partner the victor over the other, but to help them hear and truly see one another. We also want you to feel comfortable working with the specific therapist you've selected. Ideally, you and your partner will feel comfortable sharing with each other under the guidance of your therapist. But if there's something that makes you uncomfortable, the best way to solve that problem is to talk to your therapist and see if the issue can be fixed. A good therapist welcomes any input, and we like to be flexible and open to our client's needs.
Spotlight: The Gottman Method
While couples therapy can take many forms, we specialize in using the Gottman Method. The main idea of this methodology is to give priority to unresolved conflicts and to try and talk through them through the use of positive communication. The goal is to promote communication by avoiding criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling—all terms that you will become more familiar with over the course of therapy. The Gottman Method has been incredibly effective in our experience in increasing respect, intimacy, and affection in the couples we've worked with. By removing barriers toward conflict resolution, couples who are open to using this method can create a profound sense of empathy and understanding in their relationship, enough to sustain them for years to come.
Spotlight: Somatic Couples Therapy
We also provide a modified version of Somatic Therapy for couples, which essentially seeks to enhance the mind-body connection.
FAQs About Couples Therapy on Long Island
What does a therapist know about my relationship?
This is actually a great point because the benefit of having a therapist for couples therapy is the fact that they're unbiased strangers. They're not involved in your lives, and can therefore take a non-judgmental approach to help you realize where particular patterns may be emerging. Many people in long-term relationships don't even realize the things they may be doing that hurt their partner, but a trained third-party observer can find these moments and gently confront them.
What is the goal of couples therapy?
Couples therapy is very much like individual therapy in that each couple is unique and the therapy will reflect that. Furthermore, the goal of therapy is to meet the needs and preferences of the client. In couples therapy, there are two people involved, which means two sets of preferences and needs. Your therapist will do their best to honor both partners and give them both the space they need to express their goals for the relationship, whether it's to stay together, to separate gracefully, or even to establish solid footing for a younger relationship just starting out.
Why shouldn't I just end the relationship and start fresh with someone new?
Some couples feel that if they can't solve their problems on their own, they aren't right for each other. Breaking up seems like the only option. Unfortunately, this is often not the case. What we know is that people bring the same patterns and bad habits into new relationships, and continue the same cycle. Couples therapy is often more about learning about yourself so you can be a better partner in your relationship. Be aware that the goal of couples therapy is not to make a judgment about whether or not a couple should break up but rather help the people involved understand each other and their relationship from a different perspective.
What results can we expect from couples therapy?
While we cannot guarantee your relationship will continue in the way you hope for, we can assure you that by the end of your therapeutic journey you will have a much better understanding of your relationship and yourself as a partner. If both partners are willing and open to working on themselves, you will be a source of comfort and support for each other with the tools at your disposal to manage conflict in much more effective and positive ways.

trauma-therapy
"Trauma is hell on earth. Trauma resolved is a gift from the gods." — Peter A. Levine
Trauma Therapy
Trauma has lasting physical and emotional effects that can leave you tired, jumpy, anxious, feeling ashamed, exposed, insecure, and wondering who you can trust. We can't control everything that happens to us, or how we are affected by these events. However, we can help you become better at managing your trauma and reducing the symptoms associated with it.
The Nature of Trauma
Many of us experience trauma after an intense experience that may affect our mental, behavioral, and emotional well-being. Trauma can live with you for your entire life, affecting you below the surface as well as manifesting itself through your personality, your actions, and your thoughts. Often, people report not remembering a traumatic experience, but through therapy the memories start to drift back. The goal of trauma therapy is to address the underlying symptoms of trauma. The nature of the traumatic experience isn't always as important as the effect it has on your mind and body. We can't undo what we have experienced, but we certainly can become better at managing our feelings around that experience in order to live a more peaceful existence.
Benefits of Trauma Therapy
For anyone dealing with trauma, therapy that specifically targets that aspect of their mental health is incredibly beneficial. First and foremost, you can learn more about trauma itself and how it can affect people, no matter their background. When you understand how trauma manifests itself, you'll be more equipped to identify your triggers and establish a sense of safety in your daily life. Furthermore, trauma therapy can help you develop the healthy coping skills you need in order to manage your symptoms. Knowing the cause and the methods behind the therapy helps decrease traumatic stress symptoms, and stimulates the processing of your trauma in positive ways.
Spotlight: Cognitive Processing & EMDR
We find that both cognitive processing and EMDR are especially helpful for patients who have experienced trauma. Cognitive processing aims to heal the harm caused by a traumatic experience. Your therapist will help you zero in on the thoughts and feelings associated with your trauma in an effort to "rewire" how your brain reacts to those thoughts. For many of our patients, cognitive processing has helped them move past their stuck points and move forward with a healthy set of skills to manage their existing and any future trauma. EMDR, which stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing, is another tactic we use to combat trauma. EMDR is more structured and involves specific activities, like bilateral or tactile stimulation and right/left eye movement. It's a form of neurophysiological therapy that helps clients resolve issues without having to talk about them.
FAQs
How do I know if I have trauma?
Trauma is often followed by a series of symptoms, which may include unwanted memories, avoidance of people or situations, mental discomfort, and problems remembering the traumatic experience. People also report feeling anger and having a negative self-image. Although "trauma" once only referred to large-scale events like sexual assault, military combat, or car accidents, in recent years, we understand trauma to have a much more widespread effect than this. We now understand that the accumulation of smaller moments where we felt unsafe and unprotected creates another sense of complex trauma.
EMDR sounds interesting but I'm afraid of losing control of myself. How do I know if EMDR is right for me?
If you feel any of the symptoms described above, then EMDR might be something worth trying. EMDR is definitely not your normal talk therapy, but that's what's so interesting about it. Of course, the goal is always to make you feel comfortable and safe, so we would have a conversation about what it would entail and then you would be able to make your decision.
What can I do outside of therapy to help me with my trauma?
Our two main tips are: stay active and don't self-isolate. Working out, doing yoga, and even meditating can be effective at releasing endorphins and maintaining your physical health, not to mention reclaiming your felt sense of safety within your physical body. Going out and making new friends can always be helpful in fulfilling your emotional and social needs.
Do I have to talk about my trauma?
Of course not. While talking is beneficial to both yourself and your therapist because they get to know your story better, we understand that trauma is a serious situation and we would never want to make you talk about something you're not comfortable doing so. It is however incredibly empowering to own your story and to re-shape the narrative as you see fit. When you begin to talk about what happened to you, the trauma loses its power over you and you are able to resume control.

weight-loss-surgery-support
"What we change inwardly will change outer reality." — Plutarch
Weight Loss Surgery Support
Weight loss surgery comes with a lot of caveats, and an often overlooked part of the procedure is its psychological effects. By talking to a professional and others who have gone through similar experiences, you can better prepare yourself for the road ahead and increase your chances of success.
Education & Validation
Whether or not you have already made the decision to have weight loss surgery, it's important to learn as much as you can about the surgery and its effects before going through with the procedure. You may not think that weight loss surgery has effects other than your physical recovery, but these kinds of procedures often affect your mental health as well. Having some support before experiencing a potentially serious surgery can also help you validate the reasons behind your decision. This is a big decision, and it makes sense that you have questions. Our patients often ask themselves: Am I going to be okay? Am I doing the right thing? Is the surgery worth the risk? These questions change based on the individual, so in order to answer these questions for yourself we highly encourage you to reach out.
Before & After
There are many aspects to having weight loss surgery, and we like to take a comprehensive approach by preparing you beforehand and supporting you after the surgery. As a pre-op measure, we offer a weight loss surgery psychological evaluation. This puts you in a room with a professional who will help answer any questions and provide thoughtful feedback on your decision. This is not meant to make you feel inadequate or "crazy"—rather, the goal is to determine your eating habits and see if they're tied to any underlying mental health issues. Nobody wants to have surgery only to regain the weight, so our evaluation is only a precautionary measure to help you during post-op. After the surgery, it's time to celebrate the successes and create new habits. Post-op support comes in the form of being able to share your experiences with your new body and also rededicating yourself to maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
Spotlight: Weight Loss Surgery Support Group
For some patients, the most valuable resource we provide is the support group, where people going through similar weight-loss surgeries can speak freely about their experiences. The groups can be incredibly diverse, ranging from people who have only just started thinking about surgery to those who had surgeries years prior and are just looking to check-in. It's a refreshing setting for anyone involved in having weight loss surgery, and you can hear advice from people who have gone through the same situation in which you may find yourself.
FAQs
My doctor has answered all my questions. Why should I go to therapy on top of getting the surgery?
More often than not, doctors require patients to have a psychological evaluation prior to their surgery. Everyone involved wants for this surgery to be a success for you, and part of that involves identifying your strengths, motivations, and potential areas where you may need extra support after your surgery. Beyond that, we recommend our weight loss surgery support group because it's always nice to meet other people who can provide some insight into your experience.
What are some other benefits of joining the support group?
Other than making strong connections with others who are going or have gone through the same situations, we provide advice on recipes, exercises, and other activities you can do to maintain a healthy lifestyle. We want you to feel accomplished, and being a part of a support group is exactly that—to show you are appreciated and that you matter.
Can I bring a relative to the support group?
Of course! Our goal, as always, is for you to feel comfortable and safe. Sometimes people would rather not come to the group alone, and we understand and honor that. Bringing someone else has the advantage of having someone there for support and also providing them with the context for your surgery.

veterans-first-responders
Therapy for Veterans & First Responders on Long Island
Protecting the wellbeing of those who protect us
Strong. Tough. Warrior. Hero. Veterans and first responders are often associated with these words—and with good reason. These monikers are meant as an honor for those who do us the immense service of being the first to engage in a tragedy, war, or emergency. But what happens when you don't feel tough or strong? Where do you turn when your hero badge feels like a cage and you're facing loneliness and loss that others struggle to understand? The very experiences that set you apart as an honorable part of our society can make it feel difficult to participate in society as a whole person when you feel like you've been taken apart. We want to support you to find your Pathways Within, back to your true self and all the parts that make up the hero you're perceived as. With experts trained in the tools and therapies designed to support veterans and first responders, we're here and ready to help.
Speaking up is not weak.
Asking for help is a show of the very strength and bravery you're known for. Therapy has many benefits for veterans and first responders. Being able to find supported healing with a professional trained in the things you've been through or are experiencing like: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Anxiety or Panic Attacks, Depression, Isolation or feelings of detachment, Difficulty regulating your mood, Substance abuse.
You don't need to be able to identify the support you need to be deserving of receiving it. We are here to help you heal, and part of that journey is navigating what you've experienced and where you're still stuck. Trauma isn't linear, and neither is healing. No matter where you are on your journey, we can find our way forward together. If you are experiencing suicidal thoughts, ideation, or feel otherwise at risk of self-harm, please do not wait for an appointment. Please seek help immediately by calling 911. You can also access immediate support through the Veteran Crisis Line.
Unique Experiences. Unique tools.
To engage in a healing relationship with the work you've done and the wounds you bear for it, we have curated a special set of tools tailored specifically for those who may be experiencing the repercussions of their noble work. While no two therapeutic journeys are alike, the life experiences of those who have spent time in active crisis spaces stand apart from other professional roles. Your status as a helper has taken on a large portion of your identity and colored the way you've moved through the world as a person, as a professional, and the lens through which you see the world—even when you've left those spaces.
For Veterans
The life of a service member is unique. While you're serving, you remain busy with frequent relocations and unique obligations that make it hard to connect with a sense of community outside the military. Once you leave, the loss of that community offers you roots but may have you feeling ungrounded. When coupled with the high instances of stress and crisis exposure, veterans are at a higher risk for depression, loneliness, and isolation even after their time is served. We offer tools to support you in overcoming what you've been through and preparing for what you may experience in the future. Through therapeutic experiences tailored to your lifestyle, needs, and past, we will cultivate a unique plan consisting of therapies like talk therapy, EMDR, or IET to ensure you feel you've got a plan in place to heal and manage whatever may come your way.
For First Responders
Crisis response is a part of your job. Every day, you are facing things that reshape the lives of those you encounter. Your work, your presence, and your impact are felt in the "once in a lifetime" moments that you face time and again—yet each one is as unique as the mark it will leave on you. You are not bad at your job if you are struggling to reconcile the things you've seen or the way you feel. Leaving work at work isn't an option for first responders, and we want to ensure you've got the tools you need to draw boundaries that allow you to find peace in your life and healing in the trauma often left behind by such formative work. Whether you are working in everyday front-line service or are trained to respond to disasters and unprecedented events, you're more than your job. Your mental health matters and we want to support you.
When you're both
When you've had multiple high-stress, crisis-facing roles in your life, you may feel both defined by them and divided by them. The American Psychological Association has indicated a high crossover in modalities and therapeutic experience style for veterans and first responders. We combine a variety of therapeutic styles to create a custom plan just for you, designed with you in mind and tailored to your needs. Your healing journey may include puzzling together the shape of your peace, but there is one thing we can always guarantee: you will have a voice in not only your healing but how we work toward it. If you aren't ready to talk about your struggles face to face, virtual support is available. Pathways Within is happy to offer telehealth therapy to meet a variety of needs and offer ongoing psychological care, no matter where your work takes you in the world.

somatic-therapy
"True wealth is having a healthy mind, body, and spirit. True wealth is having the knowledge to maneuver and navigate the mental obstacles that inhibit your ability to soar." — Ru Paul
Somatic Therapy
Our bodies have eternal memories. Whether we remember our experiences or not, they live in our nervous system, our digestive system, our head, neck, shoulders. These are the places where trauma hides from plain view, and somatic therapy seeks to heal the body from the tension associated with trauma.
Trauma Locked in the Body
Somatic Therapy is built on the idea that our bodies are affected by the traumas we may have experienced in the past. Everything we have experienced stays in the memory of our bodies, in gestures and facial expressions, in posture, pain, or other forms of body language. Somatic therapy seeks to address the underlying issues that manifest themselves in your body. If we think about our bodies in biological terms, we can better understand how stress affects our nervous system. In our past, stress was beneficial and necessary—if a mountain lion was chasing you, you needed to run away! Now, our concerns are not as urgent but our body still interprets them in similar ways. Our bodies don't know the difference between being chased by a mountain lion and wondering how to respond to a rude email. Sōma is Greek for body, and that's the cornerstone of somatic psychotherapy. It focuses on the body and how trauma has embedded itself in your physical being. We may be great at convincing ourselves and rationalizing different things, but our bodies don't lie.
How Somatic Therapy Works
Talk therapy can often be enough to reveal causes and symptoms of mental health issues. However, when a person undergoes trauma, talking through it could be harmful or simply not beneficial. Somatic therapy looks at how the body is manifesting trauma by paying attention to any digestive issues, muscular tension, pain in certain areas of the body, sexual obstacles, etc. Throughout somatic therapy, you are guided to feel more attuned to your body's messages. This type of therapy does involve light touching in order to determine what areas are especially sensitive. For instance, your therapist may encourage you to touch your shoulder and feel where the tension resides, or your therapist could use their hands to support your shoulder and help you find a position that offers less tension. The ultimate goal is to provide you with insight into your mind-body connection that will benefit you for the rest of your life. Somatic therapy has been known to reduce stress and provide opportunities to address physical and emotional problems. Knowing how to listen to your body will ensure you stay both healthy and aware of the underlying issues you may face.
FAQs
What if I don't like being touched?
Often people who have undergone trauma do not like being touched, and that is perfectly normal. However, it's important to consider the benefits associated with somatic therapy. We try to set up a safe environment where you get to decide your comfort level, and any contact during a session is up to you. Sometimes, physical contact is replaced by self-touching or moving around a physical space. Our goal is to help you in whatever way works best for you.
What's the difference between stress and trauma?
Both stress and trauma are associated with events that impact you negatively. Stress is the immediate aftermath of the event, while trauma is caused when a person can't let go of the impact caused by the event, or otherwise termed chronic stress. For this reason, trauma is deeper and thus manifests itself in our nervous system and other parts of the body.
I went through a traumatic experience, but it was a long time ago. How could somatic therapy help me?
Trauma is like a wine stain on a white shirt. It can be covered up, and you can forget about it, but in the end, it's still there. We don't often aim to "cure" trauma because it's so deep-seated in our consciousness and our bodies that sometimes that task is impossible. What we aim for, rather, is to manage trauma and to provide you with coping skills in order to target symptoms of trauma in the body.
Do I have to talk about my trauma?
Of course not. While talking is beneficial to both yourself and your therapist because they get to know your story better, we understand that trauma is a serious situation and we would never want to make you talk about something you're not comfortable doing so. Moreover, the focus of somatic therapy is the body, so more often than not, the type of trauma is not as important as the effect it's having on your body.

emdr-therapy
EMDR Therapy on Long Island
Are you ready to heal, but less prepared to revisit the details of traumatic or repressed memories? What if we told you that with the support of a trained therapist, we can use your eyes to navigate the healing processes in your brain? EMDR can help you heal without spending a lot of time rehashing the things that hurt you.
There is nothing wrong with you if you struggle to talk about what's happened to you.
Trauma can be difficult to process. In order to truly move past the things you've gone through, it requires re-living them. This is understandably difficult and can be an exhausting process. If the thought of talking at length about old hurts and hard feelings makes you feel uncertain or overwhelmed with anxiety, EMDR therapy may be the tool you've been looking for.
EMDR is internationally recognized as a beneficial treatment to heal the brain from the residual and lingering effects of trauma.
With over 3 decades of research behind it, Eye Movement Desensitization And Reprocessing is often used to treat PTSD and other trigger-based trauma disorders but that's not all it can do.
EMDR can treat:

Anxiety
Panic Attacks and Phobias
Dissociative disorders
Sleep disturbances
Sexual Assault Recovery
Performance Anxiety
Personality Disorders
Chronic Health conditions
Depression
Grief and Loss
Stress Management
Substance Abuse
Eating Disorders
Mood regulation

What makes EMDR different?
When that conversation breaks down, so does your ability to heal from the things that happened in the places it stopped effectively communicating. You freeze—permanently trapped in the alarm state of those events instead of moving through the stages of processing we typically have in response to them. To effectively heal, your brain needs to have a conversation with itself. Three different parts of your brain are involved in that conversation. Respectively, they're responsible for stress response (fight or flight), learning (both making memories and assessing danger) and behavior analysis (what you'll do and what others are doing).
EMDR works by using repetitive rhythmic stimulation to help push your brain through that freeze so it can organically resume the healing process it's been trapped in. The stimulation we use is often a repetitive eye movement, but may also include things like tapping with your hands, or external cues like a tone or sound that's repeated.
This bilateral stimulation is substituted for the time we often spend dwelling on experiences and emotions. Instead, you'll briefly recall the trauma you experienced while also experiencing this repeated stimulation. This begins a process of reducing the vividness of your response by allowing your brain to do the work of healing without the need of prolonged emotional exposure to the memory.
Wondering what to expect in EMDR Therapy?
While the therapeutic experience isn't the same for everyone, EMDR Treatment is a structured process. Don't worry, there's no one standing over you expecting your response to be as uniform as the guidelines. There's plenty of room to move at your own pace and comfort level.
Phase 1: Introductions and history gathering so we're familiar with one another before we begin.
Phase 2: Getting you ready. It's a priority for us to ensure you always know what to expect.
Phase 3: Assessing what it is you'd like to target. We'll identify the memory, sticky spot or trigger to focus on.
Phases 4-7: These are the active EMDR phases where we use repetitive exposures to create new pathways for your brain to heal. EMDR relies on Adaptive Information Processing, so during these phases, we're focused on rewriting your memory storage.
Phase 8: Results and evaluation. We'll review your treatment together and the results of our work. This gives you the space to determine how you feel now, and what comes next.
Powerfully to the point:
If you only have a fixed amount of time or are looking to do focused work on overcoming a single trigger, EMDR is a great choice for your therapeutic tool. While it can be used alongside or within many therapy modalities, you can begin to see improvement quite quickly without the intensive exposure to your triggers that may have held you back from seeking the support you deserve. When we are working through a single memory, you can expect to have 1-3 sessions with your therapist. For prolonged trauma healing, EMDR treatment often lasts for 6-12 sessions that can be done weekly, with some sessions occurring on consecutive days.

hypnotherapy
"The easier you can make it inside your head, the easier it will make things outside your head." — Richard Bandler
Hypnotherapy
Do you ever wish you could mute the external noise of the world and turn inward to decipher the things you're feeling? Hypnotherapy is the intentional induction of a gentle trance-like state to allow your unconscious mind some time in the driver's seat. By releasing the obligation of conscious feeling, hypnotherapy can help you to release the lingering grasp of psychological, emotional, and somatic experiences.
