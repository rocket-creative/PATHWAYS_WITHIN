Let us help you build a beautiful outside that matches your inside.
Call 516-336-9209 to Book
You deserve to love what you see when you look in the mirror. Loving yourself is not about the way you look, but it can make a difference to feel like what you see on the outside matches the aspirations you're reaching for from within. Loving yourself matters above all else- above what you're told you should be or want or need.
But it doesn't matter what we think. It's what you think that matters.
Your body, your confidence, and your image are yours to own. They're yours to dictate. If you're ready to change the skin that you're in so you can feel your confidence from the top of your head to the depths of your soul, we want to invite you to follow that pathway to wellness within.
At Pathways Within, we embrace the truth that taking care of yourself physically has major impacts on your mental and emotional health. Being well is an inside job, but often the way we feel about ourselves moves in reverse. From the outside in, we build ideas about who we are and what we should be.
All Services At Pathways Within Wellness, we provide personalized care to tend to your mind, body and spirit so that you can be your best self, inside and out.

ACUPUNCTURE SERVICES ON LONG ISLAND
Acupuncture
Traditional acupuncture is an ancient healing practice that has been used for thousands of years. Our licensed acupuncturist uses this time-tested technique to help you achieve optimal health and wellness by balancing the flow of energy (Qi) throughout your body.
THE HISTORY AND SCIENCE OF ACUPUNCTURE
Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine practice that dates back over 2,500 years. It is based on the concept that health and wellness come from the balanced flow of energy, known as Qi (pronounced "chee"), throughout the body. When this energy is blocked or out of balance, illness and discomfort can result.
Modern research has shown that acupuncture stimulates the nervous system and releases endorphins, which are natural pain-relieving chemicals produced by the body. This ancient practice has been shown to be effective in treating a wide range of health conditions.

Does acupuncture hurt?
Most clients report that acupuncture is not painful. The needles used are very thin and are inserted gently. You may feel a slight sensation when the needle is inserted, but this quickly fades.
How many sessions will I need?
The number of sessions needed depends on your individual condition and health goals. Some clients experience relief after just one session, while others may need multiple sessions. Our acupuncturist will work with you to develop a treatment plan.
How long does each session last?
A typical acupuncture session lasts about 30-45 minutes, including consultation and treatment.
What should I expect during my first session?
During your first session, we'll discuss your health history and goals. The acupuncturist will then perform an assessment and create a customized treatment plan for you.
Can acupuncture be combined with other treatments?
Yes, acupuncture can be combined with other wellness treatments to enhance results. Many clients benefit from combining acupuncture with massage, energy work, or other therapies.

PRP VAMPIRE FACIAL SERVICES ON LONG ISLAND
PRP Vampire Facial
Turn back the clock with our PRP Vampire Facial, a cutting-edge anti-aging treatment that harnesses the power of your own blood to rejuvenate and revitalize your skin.
WHAT IS A PRP VAMPIRE FACIAL?
A PRP (Platelet-Rich Plasma) Vampire Facial is an advanced aesthetic procedure that uses your own blood to stimulate collagen production and rejuvenate the skin. The procedure involves extracting a small amount of blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then applying the platelet-rich plasma to the face through micro-needling or topical application.
THE SCIENCE BEHIND PRP
Platelets contain growth factors that stimulate collagen production, improve skin texture, and promote cellular renewal. When applied to the skin through micro-needling, the growth factors penetrate deeply, triggering the body's natural healing response and promoting new collagen formation.
BENEFITS OF PRP VAMPIRE FACIAL
Stimulates Collagen Production
PRP promotes natural collagen production, leading to firmer, more youthful-looking skin.
Improves Skin Texture
The treatment smooths fine lines and wrinkles, improving overall skin texture and appearance.
Reduces Fine Lines and Wrinkles
By stimulating collagen, PRP reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.
Improves Skin Tone and Radiance
PRP promotes a more even skin tone and a radiant, glowing complexion.
Natural and Safe
Since the plasma is derived from your own blood, there's no risk of allergic reactions or rejection.
Long-Lasting Results
Results improve over time as collagen continues to build, with results lasting 12-18 months or longer.
THE TREATMENT PROCESS

Blood Draw: A small amount of blood is drawn from your arm.
Processing: The blood is placed in a centrifuge to separate and concentrate the platelets.
Micro-needling: A device with tiny needles creates micro-channels in the skin.
PRP Application: The concentrated PRP is applied to the micro-needled skin, allowing the growth factors to penetrate deeply.
Healing: Over the following weeks and months, collagen production increases, and skin improves.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Is the PRP Vampire Facial safe?
Yes, the PRP Vampire Facial is a safe procedure since it uses your own blood, eliminating the risk of allergic reactions or transmission of bloodborne diseases.
Does it hurt?
The procedure involves some discomfort during the micro-needling phase, but numbing cream is applied to minimize pain. Most clients describe it as tolerable.
How long does a treatment take?
A typical PRP Vampire Facial takes about 60-90 minutes from start to finish.
When will I see results?
Initial results can be seen within 2-3 weeks, with continued improvement over 3-6 months as collagen production increases.
How many treatments do I need?
Many clients see good results with 1-3 treatments, spaced 4-6 weeks apart. Your provider can recommend the best treatment plan for your goals.

When exposed to extreme cold, the body's natural response is to redirect blood flow from the extremities to the core to protect vital organs. Once the exposure ends, blood rapidly returns to the extremities, bringing nutrient-rich, oxygenated blood that promotes healing and reduces inflammation.
BENEFITS OF CRYOTHERAPY
Reduces Inflammation
Cryotherapy is highly effective at reducing inflammation throughout the body.
Accelerates Recovery
Athletes and active individuals use cryotherapy to speed up muscle recovery after intense workouts or competition.
Improves Athletic Performance
Regular cryotherapy sessions can enhance athletic performance and endurance.
Boosts Immune Function
Cold exposure stimulates the immune system, helping your body fight off illness.
Reduces Pain
The anti-inflammatory effects of cryotherapy help reduce chronic pain conditions.
Improves Mood and Mental Health
Cryotherapy triggers the release of endorphins, improving mood and promoting mental wellness.
Enhances Skin Health
Improved circulation and reduced inflammation can lead to clearer, healthier-looking skin.
THE CRYOTHERAPY PROCESS

Preparation: You'll change into minimal clothing and remove any metal jewelry.
Chamber Entry: You'll enter the cryotherapy chamber, which will gradually cool down.
Exposure: The chamber reaches extreme cold temperatures for 2-3 minutes.
Exit: The chamber warms up, and you exit feeling energized.
Recovery: Most people report feeling the benefits within 15-30 minutes.

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Is cryotherapy safe?
Yes, whole-body cryotherapy is safe when performed by trained professionals. The exposure time is brief, and the chamber is carefully monitored.
How cold does the chamber get?
The chamber reaches temperatures around -200°F (-130°C), but you're protected from frostbite by the brief exposure time.
How often should I do cryotherapy?
For athletic recovery, 3-5 times per week is recommended. For general wellness, 1-2 times per week is beneficial.
What should I expect to feel?
Most people report feeling invigorated and energized immediately after treatment. Over time, clients notice reduced inflammation and improved recovery.
Can everyone use cryotherapy?
Cryotherapy is safe for most people, but certain conditions may make it inadvisable. We recommend consulting with our specialists if you have any health concerns.
How long do the benefits last?
Acute benefits like improved mood and energy can last several hours. Anti-inflammatory effects build with regular treatments.

Laser Lipo
Get a laser focus on your wellness goals by redefining your relationship with your body. You can start right here, right now, and let laser lipo give you a cutting edge without any cutting at all.
MELT AND TONE WITH CONFIDENCE
You've been working so hard to build the holistic self you want, so let this trusted treatment do some of the work for you. One of the first FDA-approved treatments for non-invasive fat reduction, laser lipo can help you to achieve the body shaping that will help you feel as good about your outside appearance as you do about your inner strength. Laser lipo has been a trusted tool in body contouring confidence for over 15 years.
BENEFITS OF LASER LIPO
Non-invasive
Reduces Stubborn Fat
No downtime
Enhances collagen production
Immediate results
Improves the appearance of the skin too!
BECOME YOUR NEW BEGINNING
Lasers, vacuums, and lymphatic drainage oh my! It all sounds like so much, but ultimately it just means you can re-create your shape to reflect the wellness you're curating. Laser lipo offers you a precision tool to literally trim the fat that no longer serves you. As you rewrite your confidence and move toward a brighter future, let the goals you have for your body align with the brilliance of your hard work.
SKIN SCIENCE: HOW LASER LIPO BANISHES FAT
The chain of events that occur beneath the surface of your skin while you relax and let laser lipo sculpt your scorching confidence is a busy one. So many things take place that you never see - so let's talk about them.
When you arrive, you'll be taken into one of our spa-like treatment rooms and prepared for your service. Your experience begins when the laser lipo paddles are applied to the targeted area. Penetrating deeply and harmlessly through the upper layers of your skin (epithelial cells), the fat-seeking lasers exclusively target cells called adipocyte cells that rapidly respond to the new intrusion. The specially designed lasers create pores in the cells that allow them to sneak through barrier layers and damage the cell's stability. As the laser sneaks in, the water, fat, and glycogen that keep fat cells healthy will spill out into the surrounding tissue as incomplete acid chains. The body will reabsorb them, shrinking the cells as they lose what shapes them. With none of these elements to refuel them, the fat cells lose their power and are banished.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
How long does it take?
Each area treated takes 30 minutes and has the potential to remove 1-4" from the treated area. You'll see results immediately, but they'll also continue to develop over time so your half-hour of laser treatment will be the gift that keeps on giving for up to 6 weeks of transformation.
How many sessions will I need?
You'll see results from just your first session, but if there are other areas you'd like to treat or more contouring you want to see when you look at your body, we can curate custom packages to meet your needs. From a treat yourself single to an ongoing plan, we will meet you where you'd like!
Who benefits most from Laser Lipo?
Those looking to trim and change a body that's already been changing are ideal candidates for laser lipo. Your results will be best if you've experienced some weight loss or are within 25 lbs of your desired body shape. There is nothing wrong with your body, and laser lipo will not overhaul the ideas you have about it. It can simply reinforce the confidence you're working toward already.
What are the risks?
There are minimal risks with laser lipo. It's non-invasive so no cutting or downtime to plague a busy schedule. You may experience some tenderness at the site of the treatment, or feel a bit sore for the days after. Some people feel dehydrated or experience minor swelling so staying on top of your water drinking and treating yourself to some relaxation may help you to see the best results after treatment.

PAGE 16: TEETH WHITENING
Title: Teeth Whitening on Long Island — Pathways Within Wellness Services on Long Island

WELLNESS SPA | LONG ISLAND
Teeth Whitening
Your smile is how you say hello to the world before you speak. From boisterous laughter to gentle encouragement, let your smile speak for you with brilliant clarity. Teeth whitening can boost your confidence so you're ready to show off that smile at a moment's notice.
TREAT YOURSELF
Your teeth are resilient, but they're also porous and responsive. Throughout your lifetime, they will encounter many substances and experiences that may dull their sparkle or stain the surface of your smile. While staining on your teeth isn't dangerous or damaging on its own, it can damage your confidence in major ways. With cosmetic teeth whitening, you can experience a reversal of the staining that comes from food, drink, and other substances so you love the sparkle of your smile again.
TEETH WHITENING: LOW EFFORT, HIGH IMPACT
Teeth whitening is a simple and often relaxing experience. In one of our spa-like treatment rooms, you'll have a tool that gently lifts the lips away from your teeth applied before brilliant blue light bleaches away stains on the surface of your teeth. As the light is absorbed by the tooth, it will sink deep within and slowly erase the discoloration from the innermost surfaces of your teeth. Teeth whitening requires little preparation and is an affordable treatment that immediately transforms the radiance of your smile. Your whiter teeth can make your skin look richer, lips look more pigmented and enhance the megawatt delight you'll feel at the cosmetic confidence we can offer you through teeth whitening.
WHY DO TEETH STAIN?
Teeth may stain from a variety of different causes. Intrinsic (beneath the surface) and extrinsic (on top of the tooth) stains occur from early on in our lives. Some of the most common causes of tooth discoloration are:

Excessive fluoride
Wine
Trauma
Age
Coffee
Sodas
Tobacco
Medication
Some Foods

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Is it safe?
Teeth whitening is safe for almost everyone. There are no adverse effects on healthy teeth and no downtime. Teeth whitening is cosmetic, noninvasive, and completely risk-free for healthy teeth. If you are concerned about previous dental issues, consult your dentist before scheduling your teeth whitening session.
Is there a way to keep my teeth white?
After treatment, you can prolong the result you see to keep a confident smile by mindfully brushing after consuming heavily pigmented drinks like wine, coffee, or dark soda, and eliminating tobacco products. Additionally, using baking soda or charcoal toothpaste can help to keep the surface of the tooth in that sparkling post-whitening glamour.
How long does it take?
Teeth whitening treatments take from 15-45 minutes depending on the intensity and consultation plan you create with your clinician. It's a fairly quick experience and you'll know exactly how much time you should allot when you make your appointment.
How long do results last?
Teeth whitening is not a permanent fix, so to maintain your results, cosmetic teeth whitening can become a part of your regular self-care treatments. Without repeat sessions, you can expect results to last from a couple of months to more than a year!

THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE HYDRAFACIAL
The HydraFacial is a powerful skin resurfacing treatment that combines advanced technology with proven ingredients to deliver maximum results. The process begins with a gentle exfoliation that removes the outer layer of dead skin cells, followed by a deep-cleansing extraction to clear out dirt and oil from your pores. The next step is a special serum that is applied to replenish your skin's moisture and nourish it with antioxidants and other vitamins and minerals. The last step is a hydrating mask that helps to lock in moisture and protect your skin.
After the treatment, we recommend avoiding direct sun exposure and wearing a broad spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to protect your skin.
