**Whether you're seeking relief from chronic pain, support for mental health, or holistic wellness care**, acupuncture offers a natural, effective approach to healing.

## The History and Science of Acupuncture

### Ancient Roots

**Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine practice** that dates back over 2,500 years. It is based on the concept that health and wellness come from the balanced flow of energy, known as **Qi (pronounced "chee")**, throughout the body.

**According to traditional Chinese medicine:**
- Qi flows through pathways called meridians
- When Qi is blocked or out of balance, illness and discomfort result
- Acupuncture needles stimulate specific points along meridians to restore flow
- Restoring balance allows the body to heal itself

### Modern Understanding

**Modern research has shown that acupuncture works through several mechanisms:**

**Nervous System Stimulation**  
Acupuncture needles stimulate nerves, sending signals to the brain and spinal cord that trigger healing responses.

**Endorphin Release**  
Acupuncture stimulates the release of endorphins—natural pain-relieving chemicals produced by your body that are more powerful than morphine.

**Inflammation Reduction**  
Studies show acupuncture reduces inflammatory markers in the body, helping with chronic pain and inflammatory conditions.

**Blood Flow Improvement**  
Needling increases local blood flow to tissues, promoting healing and reducing pain.

**Neurotransmitter Regulation**  
Acupuncture affects levels of serotonin, dopamine, and other brain chemicals that regulate mood, pain perception, and wellbeing.

**This ancient practice has been validated by modern science**—which is why it's increasingly integrated into conventional medical care.

- Discuss your health history in detail

### During the Acupuncture Treatment

**Needle Insertion (5-10 minutes)**

Your acupuncturist will:
- Have you lie comfortably on a treatment table
- Insert very thin, sterile needles at specific points
- Use as few as 5 or as many as 20+ needles, depending on your condition

**Rest Period (20-30 minutes)**

After needle placement:
- You'll rest quietly while the needles do their work
- Soft music may play
- Lights are dimmed for relaxation
- Many people fall asleep or enter a deeply meditative state

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does acupuncture hurt?

**No, acupuncture is not painful for most people.**

**Here's why it doesn't hurt:**
- The needles are incredibly thin (hair-thin)

- The practitioner inserts them with great skill and care
- Once in place, you usually don't feel them

**You may feel:**
- A brief pinch upon insertion (1-2 seconds)
- A dull ache, warmth, or tingling (this is called "de qi" and indicates the treatment is working)

**If you do feel sharp pain**, tell your acupuncturist immediately. They'll adjust the needle. Acupuncture should never be painful.
