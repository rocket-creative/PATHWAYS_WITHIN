## The Body Remembers What the Mind Forgets

**Our bodies have eternal memories.** Whether we consciously remember our experiences or not, they live in our nervous system, our digestive system, our head, neck, and shoulders. These are the places where trauma hides from plain view, and somatic therapy seeks to heal the body from the tension and pain associated with trauma.

**You might not remember the details of what happened to you**, but your body does. It remembers through:
- Chronic muscle tension that won't release
- Digestive issues with no clear medical cause
- Persistent pain that doctors can't explain
- Difficulty breathing deeply
- Constant state of alert or hypervigilance
- Feeling disconnected from your body
- Numbness or lack of sensation
- Sexual difficulties or avoidance
- Fatigue that sleep doesn't fix

**Somatic therapy recognizes that healing trauma requires addressing not just your thoughts and emotions, but also what's happening in your physical body.**

## Trauma Locked in the Body

**Somatic therapy is built on the understanding that our bodies are profoundly affected by the traumas we've experienced.** Everything we have lived through stays in the memory of our bodies—in gestures and facial expressions, in posture, in pain, and in other forms of body language.

### The Biology of Stress and Trauma

**To understand somatic therapy, it helps to understand how stress affects your nervous system** from a biological perspective.

**In our evolutionary past, stress was beneficial and necessary.** If a mountain lion was chasing you, your body needed to activate immediately:
- Heart rate increases (to pump blood to muscles)
- Breathing becomes rapid and shallow (to get oxygen quickly)
- Muscles tense (ready to fight or run)
- Digestion shuts down (not a priority during danger)
- Senses sharpen (to detect threats)
- Blood flow redirects to survival systems

**This is the "fight or flight" response**, and it's designed to save your life in the face of immediate physical danger.

**Here's the problem:** Our modern concerns are rarely about immediate physical survival, but **our bodies still interpret stress the same way.** Your body doesn't know the difference between being chased by a mountain lion and:
- Wondering how to respond to a hostile email
- Sitting in traffic when you're late
- Having a conflict with your partner
- Worrying about finances
- Remembering a traumatic event from your past

**When stress becomes chronic** (ongoing for weeks, months, or years), or when you experience trauma that your nervous system can't fully process, **your body can get stuck in a perpetual state of activation or shutdown.**

### What "Stuck" Looks Like

**Hyperarousal (fight or flight stuck "on"):**
- Constant anxiety or panic
- Hypervigilance (always scanning for danger)
- Insomnia or difficulty sleeping
- Irritability, anger outbursts
- Difficulty relaxing or feeling safe
- Chronic muscle tension
- Digestive issues

**Hypoarousal (freeze or collapse):**
- Numbness, emotional flatness
- Dissociation (feeling disconnected from yourself or reality)
- Extreme fatigue or lethargy
- Depression
- Difficulty feeling pleasure
- Sense of hopelessness
- Feeling like you're watching life from outside your body

**Many people alternate between these states**, oscillating between feeling too much and feeling nothing at all.

## Sōma: The Cornerstone of Somatic Therapy

**Sōma is Greek for "body,"** and that's the cornerstone of somatic psychotherapy. It focuses on the body and how trauma has embedded itself in your physical being.

**We may be great at convincing ourselves and rationalizing different things**, but **our bodies don't lie.** Your mind might say "I'm fine, it doesn't bother me anymore," while your body screams the truth through:
- Clenched jaw and shoulders that climb toward your ears
- Holding your breath or shallow breathing
- Stomach in knots
- Inability to make eye contact
- Hunched, protective posture
- Flinching at unexpected touch or sound

**Somatic therapy bypasses the mind's defenses and works directly with what the body is holding.**

## How Somatic Therapy Works

**Talk therapy can often reveal causes and symptoms of mental health issues.** For many people, it's incredibly effective. **However, when a person has undergone trauma, talking through it could be harmful, retraumatizing, or simply not sufficient for healing.**

**Somatic therapy looks at how the body is manifesting trauma** by paying attention to:
- Digestive issues (IBS, nausea, loss of appetite)
- Muscular tension (chronic pain, headaches, TMJ)
- Pain in certain areas of the body (often where trauma occurred or where you were hurt)
- Sexual obstacles (pain, numbness, avoidance, difficulty with intimacy)
- Breathing patterns (shallow chest breathing vs. deep belly breathing)
- Posture and movement (protective stances, collapsed posture)
- Nervous system activation (heart rate, sweating, trembling)

### The Therapeutic Process

**Throughout somatic therapy, you're guided to feel more attuned to your body's messages.** This might sound simple, but for people with trauma, connecting to bodily sensations can be incredibly difficult—and incredibly healing.

**A typical session might include:**

**Body Awareness Practices**  
Learning to notice what's happening in your body moment to moment without judgment. "Where do you feel that emotion in your body?" "What sensations are you aware of right now?"

**Grounding Techniques**  
Practices that help you feel present in your body and connected to the earth. This might include feeling your feet on the floor, noticing your breath, or using your senses to anchor to the present moment.

**Resourcing**  
Identifying internal and external resources that help you feel safe, calm, and regulated. This creates a foundation of safety before processing trauma.

**Titration**  
Working with small amounts of traumatic activation at a time, rather than overwhelming yourself. You learn to approach the edge of discomfort, then return to safety, gradually expanding your capacity.

**Pendulation**  
Moving between sensations of tension/distress and sensations of ease/comfort. This teaches your nervous system flexibility instead of being stuck in one state.

**Discharge and Completion**  
Allowing your body to complete survival responses that got interrupted during trauma. This might involve shaking, crying, movements, or sounds that release trapped energy.

### The Role of Touch

**This type of therapy can involve light, consensual touch** to help you become aware of where tension resides in your body.

**For instance:**
- Your therapist may encourage you to touch your own shoulder and feel where the tension is
- Your therapist might use their hands to gently support your shoulder, helping you find a position that offers less tension
- Touch is always optional, consensual, and you control what happens

**The ultimate goal is to provide you with insight into your mind-body connection** that will benefit you for the rest of your life.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "What if I don't like being touched?"

**Often people who have undergone trauma do not like being touched, and that is perfectly normal.** In fact, it's one of the most common concerns we hear.

**However, it's important to consider the benefits** associated with somatic therapy, even if touch makes you uncomfortable.

**Here's how we handle this:**

**You are always in control.** Any contact during a session is completely up to you. We establish clear consent before any touch occurs, and you can change your mind at any time.

**Touch is not required.** Sometimes physical contact is replaced by:
- Self-touch (you touching your own body)
- Guided body awareness without touch
- Movement practices
- Working with the space between us
- Tracking sensations through verbal description

**We create a safe environment** where you get to decide your comfort level at every moment. Our goal is to help you in whatever way works best for you, and that includes respecting your boundaries absolutely.

**Over time, as you build trust and safety**, many people find that they become more comfortable with therapeutic touch. But this is never forced or rushed.

### "What's the difference between stress and trauma?"

**Both stress and trauma are associated with events that impact you negatively**, but they're meaningfully different:

**Stress** is the immediate aftermath of challenging events. Your body activates to deal with a threat or demand, then returns to baseline once the stressor is resolved. Stress is temporary and your system can recover.

**Trauma** occurs when a person can't let go of the impact caused by the event, or experiences chronic stress that overwhelms their capacity to cope. Trauma is deeper and embeds itself in your nervous system and other parts of the body.

**In other words:** Stress is what happens during the event. Trauma is what stays with you afterward when your system can't fully process and integrate what happened.

### "I went through a traumatic experience, but it was a long time ago. How could somatic therapy help me?"

**This is one of the most important questions, and we're glad you asked.**

**Trauma is like a wine stain on a white shirt.** It can be covered up, and you can forget about it for years, but in the end, it's still there. Time alone doesn't heal trauma—it just teaches you how to avoid thinking about it.

**Your body remembers, even when your conscious mind has moved on.** That 30-year-old trauma can still be causing:
- Chronic tension and pain
- Hypervigilance and anxiety
- Relationship difficulties
- Difficulty trusting or feeling safe
- Physical health problems
- Emotional numbness or reactivity

**We don't often aim to "cure" trauma** because it's so deep-seated in our consciousness and bodies that sometimes complete erasure isn't possible or even the goal.

**What we aim for, rather, is to:**
- Help you manage trauma and its effects
- Provide coping skills to target symptoms in the body
- Release trapped energy and tension
- Restore a sense of safety in your body
- Integrate the experience so it becomes part of your history rather than your present

**It's never too late to heal.** Your body has been carrying this for you all these years. Somatic therapy offers a way to finally put it down.

### "Do I have to talk about my trauma?"

**No. Absolutely not.**

**While talking can be beneficial** to both you and your therapist (helping us understand your story better), **we understand that trauma is serious and we would never force you to discuss anything you're not comfortable sharing.**

**Moreover, the focus of somatic therapy is the body**, so more often than not, the specific details of what happened are less important than the effect it's having on your body right now.

**We can work effectively with:**
- "Something bad happened and I don't want to talk about it"
- "I know I carry trauma but I don't remember all the details"
- "There wasn't one big event, just a lot of difficult experiences"

**Your body will guide the work.** We don't need your story—we need your present-moment awareness and willingness to explore sensations.

## The Benefits of Somatic Therapy

**Research and clinical experience show that somatic therapy can:**

**Reduce stress and anxiety** by teaching your nervous system how to regulate and return to calm

**Provide opportunities to address physical and emotional problems** that haven't responded to other treatments

**Improve body awareness** so you can recognize when you're becoming dysregulated and intervene early

**Release chronic tension** that you've been carrying for years or decades

**Restore a sense of safety** in your own body and in the world

**Improve relationships** as you become more present, regulated, and able to connect

**Reduce physical pain** that stems from trauma and chronic stress

**Integrate traumatic experiences** so they become memories rather than ongoing present experiences

**Knowing how to listen to your body** will ensure you stay both healthy and aware of the underlying issues you may face, allowing you to address them before they become crises.
