## Are You Ready to Heal Without Rehashing Everything?

**Are you ready to heal, but less prepared to revisit the details of traumatic or repressed memories?**

What if we told you that with the support of a trained therapist, we can use bilateral stimulation—often through guided eye movements—to help your brain complete the healing processes it started but couldn't finish?

**EMDR can help you heal without spending extensive time rehashing the things that hurt you.**

## There is Nothing Wrong With You

**If you struggle to talk about what's happened to you, there is nothing wrong with you.**

Trauma can be incredibly difficult to process. To truly move past traumatic experiences using traditional talk therapy often requires re-living them in detail. This is understandably difficult and can feel exhausting, overwhelming, or even retraumatizing.

**If the thought of talking at length about old hurts and hard feelings makes you feel uncertain or fills you with anxiety, EMDR therapy may be the tool you've been looking for.**

## What is EMDR?

**EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing.**

It's an internationally recognized, evidence-based treatment to heal the brain from the residual and lingering effects of trauma. **With over three decades of research behind it**, EMDR is primarily used to treat PTSD and other trigger-based trauma disorders—but that's not all it can do.

### EMDR Can Treat:

- **Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)**
- **Anxiety disorders**
- **Panic attacks and phobias**
- **Dissociative disorders**
- **Sleep disturbances and nightmares**
- **Sexual assault recovery**
- **Performance anxiety**
- **Personality disorders** (as adjunct treatment)
- **Chronic health conditions** (psychological impact)
- **Depression**
- **Grief and loss**
- **Stress management**
- **Substance abuse** (addressing underlying trauma)
- **Eating disorders** (trauma components)
- **Mood regulation difficulties**

**EMDR has strong research support** from organizations including the American Psychological Association, the World Health Organization, and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

## What Makes EMDR Different?

### How Your Brain Processes Trauma

**To effectively heal from trauma, your brain needs to have a conversation with itself.** Three different parts of your brain are involved in that conversation:

**The Amygdala** - Responsible for stress response (fight, flight, or freeze). This is your alarm system that detects danger.

**The Hippocampus** - Responsible for learning, making memories, and assessing whether situations are actually dangerous or just remind you of danger.

**The Prefrontal Cortex** - Responsible for behavior analysis, decision-making, and understanding what you're doing and what others are doing.

**When trauma occurs**, these three parts of your brain are supposed to work together to:
1. Detect the threat (amygdala)
2. Record what happened as a memory (hippocampus)
3. Make sense of it and integrate it into your life story (prefrontal cortex)
4. File it away as "something that happened in the past" so you can move on

### When the Conversation Breaks Down

**But sometimes, when an experience is too overwhelming**, this conversation breaks down. Your brain gets stuck in the alarm state and can't move through the natural stages of processing.

**You freeze**—permanently trapped in the emotional intensity of those events instead of being able to process them as memories that happened in the past.

**This is why trauma feels like it's happening NOW**, even though it happened years or decades ago. Your brain hasn't properly filed it away as a completed event.

### How EMDR Helps

**EMDR works by using repetitive, rhythmic bilateral stimulation** to help push your brain through that freeze so it can organically resume the healing process it's been trapped in.

**The bilateral stimulation we use is often:**
- Repetitive eye movements (following the therapist's finger or a light)
- Alternating sounds in each ear through headphones
- Tapping on alternating sides of your body
- Holding buzzers that alternate vibration between your hands

**This bilateral stimulation is substituted for the time often spent dwelling on experiences and emotions.** Instead, you'll briefly recall the trauma you experienced while also experiencing this repeated stimulation.

**This begins a process of reducing the vividness and emotional charge** of your trauma response by allowing your brain to do the work of healing without the need for prolonged emotional exposure to the memory.

**Your brain already knows how to heal.** EMDR just helps it complete the process that got interrupted.

## What to Expect in EMDR Therapy

While everyone's therapeutic experience is unique, **EMDR treatment follows a structured process.** There's plenty of room to move at your own pace and comfort level—you're never rushed or pressured.

### Phase 1: History and Treatment Planning

**What happens:** We get to know each other. You share your history, and we identify what you want to work on.

**What we learn:**
- What traumatic experiences are affecting you
- How those experiences show up in your life now
- What symptoms you're experiencing
- What you hope to achieve through therapy

**You're in control:** You decide what to share and what targets to work on.

---

### Phase 2: Preparation

**What happens:** We ensure you're ready for EMDR processing and teach you coping skills.

**You'll learn:**
- What to expect during EMDR sessions
- Grounding and calming techniques to use if you feel overwhelmed
- How to create a "safe place" in your mind
- How to signal if you need to stop or slow down

**Why this matters:** EMDR can bring up intense emotions. We want you to have tools to manage them before we begin processing.

---

### Phase 3: Assessment

**What happens:** We identify the specific memory or trigger to focus on and measure the baseline distress.

**We'll ask you to identify:**
- The worst image or moment from the traumatic memory
- Negative beliefs about yourself connected to that memory ("I'm powerless," "I'm in danger," "It was my fault")
- Where you feel it in your body (tightness in chest, knot in stomach, etc.)
- How disturbing it feels right now (0-10 scale)

**We'll also identify:** The positive belief you'd like to have instead ("I'm safe now," "I did the best I could," "I have power")

---

### Phases 4-7: Desensitization, Installation, Body Scan, and Closure

**These are the active EMDR phases** where we use bilateral stimulation to help your brain reprocess the traumatic memory.

**Phase 4: Desensitization**
- You bring up the traumatic memory while following bilateral stimulation
- Your brain begins to make new connections and process the memory
- The emotional charge of the memory decreases
- We continue until the memory no longer feels disturbing

**Phase 5: Installation**
- We strengthen the positive belief you want to have
- Using bilateral stimulation, we help your brain integrate this new, adaptive belief
- "I'm safe now" becomes something you actually believe, not just something you wish were true

**Phase 6: Body Scan**
- We check for any remaining physical tension or distress related to the memory
- Process any lingering body sensations using bilateral stimulation

**Phase 7: Closure**
- We make sure you're in a stable, calm state before ending the session
- Review coping techniques to use between sessions
- Discuss what to expect after processing

---

### Phase 8: Reevaluation

**What happens:** At the start of the next session, we review your progress and determine next steps.

**We'll ask:**
- How has the targeted memory felt since last session?
- Have other memories or triggers come up?
- Are there remaining aspects that need processing?

**This gives you space to determine** how you feel now and what comes next in your healing journey.

## How Long Does EMDR Take?

**EMDR is powerful and relatively efficient.**

**For a single traumatic memory:**
You can expect 1-3 sessions to significantly reduce or eliminate distress. Some memories resolve in a single session.

**For prolonged or complex trauma:**
EMDR treatment often lasts 6-12 sessions, sometimes longer. Sessions can be weekly, or some clients prefer consecutive days for intensive work.

**Compared to years of traditional talk therapy**, EMDR can achieve results much more quickly for trauma-specific issues.

## What EMDR Feels Like

**During bilateral stimulation**, different people experience different things:

**Some people:**
- Notice the memory becoming less vivid or more distant
- Have insights or realizations about the event
- Remember details they had forgotten
- Feel physical sensations releasing from their body
- Experience emotions flowing through and then subsiding
- Notice thoughts shifting from "It was my fault" to "I was a child, it wasn't my fault"

**The experience is unique for everyone**, but most people describe feeling like something is shifting or releasing.

**After sessions**, you might:
- Feel tired (processing is hard work)
- Notice dreams related to what you processed
- Have spontaneous insights between sessions
- Feel lighter or more at peace
- Notice triggers don't bother you the way they used to

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "EMDR sounds interesting but I'm afraid of losing control. Is it right for me?"

**This is a very common concern, and we're glad you're asking.**

**Here's what we want you to know:**
- **You're always in control.** You can stop at any time, take breaks, or slow down.
- **You don't lose consciousness** or enter a trance. You're fully aware the entire time.
- **You won't be forced to confront anything** you're not ready for.
- **We establish safety first** before doing any processing work.

**If you're experiencing any trauma symptoms** (intrusive memories, avoidance, hypervigilance, emotional numbness, nightmares, triggers), then EMDR might be worth trying.

**EMDR is definitely not "normal" talk therapy**, and that's exactly what makes it so effective. But we would have a thorough conversation about what it entails, answer all your questions, and you would be able to make your decision from an informed place.

**You wouldn't start EMDR unless you felt comfortable and ready.**

### "Do I have to talk about my trauma in detail?"

**No.** This is one of the biggest advantages of EMDR.

**Unlike traditional trauma therapy**, where you might spend months discussing every detail of what happened, EMDR requires much less verbal processing.

**You need to be able to:**
- Identify that something traumatic happened
- Bring it to mind briefly
- Notice what you feel in your body

**You DON'T need to:**
- Describe every detail out loud
- Relive the entire experience verbally
- Spend session after session talking about it

**Your therapist needs to know enough to target the right memory**, but you don't have to recount everything that happened. Your brain knows the details—we're just helping it finish processing.

### "What can I do outside of therapy to help?"

**Between EMDR sessions, you can support your healing by:**

**Staying active**
- Working out, yoga, walking, or other movement
- Physical activity releases endorphins and helps regulate your nervous system

**Practicing self-compassion**
- Be gentle with yourself as memories and emotions surface
- Use the coping skills you learned in Phase 2

**Journaling**
- Note any insights, dreams, or shifts you notice
- Track how triggers affect you over time

**Not self-isolating**
- Stay connected to supportive people
- Reach out when you need help

**Trusting the process**
- Healing isn't linear—you might feel worse before you feel better
- Your brain is doing important work between sessions
