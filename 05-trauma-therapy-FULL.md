## You Don't Have to Carry This Forever

**Trauma has lasting physical and emotional effects** that can leave you feeling:
- Tired and depleted
- Jumpy and hypervigilant
- Anxious or panicked
- Ashamed or exposed
- Insecure and unsafe
- Wondering who you can trust
- Disconnected from yourself and others
- Numb or emotionally flat

**We can't control everything that happens to us, or how we're affected by these events.** However, we can help you become better at managing your trauma and reducing the symptoms associated with it.

**Healing is possible.** You deserve to feel safe again.

## The Nature of Trauma

**Many of us experience trauma after an intense experience** that may affect our mental, behavioral, and emotional wellbeing.

**Trauma can live with you for your entire life**, affecting you below the surface as well as manifesting through your personality, actions, and thoughts. Often, people report not remembering a traumatic experience clearly, but through therapy the memories start to drift back—or sometimes they never do, and that's okay too.

### What Counts as Trauma?

**"Trauma" once only referred to large-scale events** like sexual assault, military combat, or car accidents. In recent years, we've come to understand that trauma has a much more widespread effect than this.

**We now recognize:**

**Big-T Trauma (single events)**
- Sexual assault or abuse
- Physical violence
- Serious accidents
- Natural disasters
- Combat exposure
- Medical trauma
- Sudden loss of a loved one
- Witnessing violence

**Little-t Trauma (cumulative experiences)**
- Childhood emotional neglect
- Bullying or humiliation
- Divorce or family conflict
- Emotional abuse
- Betrayal or abandonment
- Chronic invalidation
- Growing up in an unsafe environment

**Complex Trauma (ongoing/repeated)**
- Childhood abuse (physical, sexual, emotional)
- Domestic violence relationships
- Long-term captivity or trafficking
- Repeated medical procedures (especially in childhood)
- Growing up with addicted or mentally ill parents
- Institutional abuse

**The accumulation of smaller moments where we felt unsafe and unprotected** creates what we call complex trauma—and it's just as valid and impactful as single-incident trauma.

## How Trauma Affects You

**Trauma isn't just "in your head"—it affects your entire being.**

### Mental & Emotional Effects

**Intrusive Memories**
- Flashbacks (feeling like it's happening again)
- Nightmares and night terrors
- Unwanted thoughts or images
- Inability to stop thinking about it

**Avoidance**
- Avoiding people, places, or situations that remind you
- Avoiding talking or thinking about what happened
- Emotional numbing
- Feeling detached from life

**Negative Changes in Thinking**
- Negative beliefs about yourself ("I'm damaged," "It was my fault")
- Negative beliefs about others ("No one is trustworthy")
- Negative beliefs about the world ("Nowhere is safe")
- Difficulty trusting
- Persistent shame, guilt, or fear
- Loss of interest in things that once mattered

**Hyperarousal (Always on Alert)**
- Being easily startled
- Feeling on edge or tense
- Difficulty sleeping
- Irritability or anger outbursts
- Difficulty concentrating
- Hypervigilance (constantly scanning for danger)

### Physical Effects

**Your body remembers what your mind might forget:**
- Chronic pain (headaches, body aches)
- Digestive issues
- Autoimmune conditions
- Sleep disturbances
- Fatigue
- Tension (tight shoulders, jaw clenching)
- Sexual difficulties
- Chronic illness

### Behavioral Effects

**Trauma often leads to:**

- Self-harm behaviors
- Eating disorders
- Risky behaviors
- Difficulty maintaining relationships
- Work or school problems
- Social isolation

---

## The Goal of Trauma Therapy

**The nature of the traumatic experience isn't always as important as the effect it has on your mind and body.**

**We can't undo what you've experienced**, but we certainly can help you:
- Understand how trauma affects you
- Identify your triggers
- Establish a sense of safety
- Develop healthy coping skills
- Process traumatic memories
- Reduce traumatic stress symptoms
- Reclaim your life

**The goal isn't to erase what happened**—it's to help you integrate the experience so it becomes part of your history rather than your present reality.

---

## Benefits of Trauma Therapy

### Learn About Trauma Itself

**Understanding how trauma manifests** helps you recognize what's happening and why.

**You'll learn:**
- How trauma affects the brain and body
- Why you react the way you do
- That your responses are normal reactions to abnormal events
- How to identify your personal triggers
- What safety means and how to create it

**Knowledge is power**—understanding your trauma reduces its control over you.

---

### Identify Triggers

**Triggers are reminders of trauma** that activate your stress response even when you're not in danger.

**Common triggers:**
- Sensory (smells, sounds, sights)
- Situational (similar places or circumstances)
- Interpersonal (relationship dynamics)
- Emotional (certain feelings)
- Dates (anniversaries of traumatic events)

**In therapy, you'll:**
- Identify what specifically triggers you
- Understand why these things are triggering
- Learn to manage triggers when they arise
- Gradually reduce the power triggers have over you

---

### Establish Safety

**Safety is the foundation of trauma recovery.**

**We'll help you create:**
- Physical safety (in your environment and relationships)
- Emotional safety (feeling safe with your feelings)
- Relational safety (trusting yourself and others appropriately)
- Internal safety (feeling safe in your own body)

**Safety work includes:**
- Grounding techniques
- Creating a safety plan
- Building support networks
- Developing self-soothing skills
- Learning to trust your instincts

---

### Develop Healthy Coping Skills

**Trauma often leads to unhealthy coping mechanisms** (substance use, self-harm, avoidance, etc.) because you're just trying to survive.

**Therapy helps you develop:**
- Emotion regulation skills
- Distress tolerance techniques
- Grounding and centering practices
- Mindfulness and present-moment awareness
- Self-compassion
- Healthy boundaries
- Effective communication

**These skills help you manage symptoms** without the destructive coping mechanisms that may have helped in the short term but hurt you long-term.

---

### Process Traumatic Memories

**When trauma isn't properly processed**, memories remain "stuck" in an unprocessed state that keeps triggering you.

**Processing helps:**
- Memories become integrated into your life story
- Emotional charge decreases
- Triggers lose their power
- You can remember without reliving
- The past stays in the past

**Various therapeutic approaches** facilitate this processing in different ways (more on this below).

---

### Reduce Symptoms

**The ultimate goal: reducing the symptoms** that are interfering with your life.

**Effective trauma therapy decreases:**
- Flashbacks and nightmares
- Avoidance behaviors
- Hypervigilance and anxiety
- Depression and emotional numbness
- Relationship difficulties
- Physical symptoms
- Self-destructive behaviors

**As symptoms decrease, you reclaim your life.**

## Therapeutic Approaches for Trauma

### Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT)

**CPT aims to heal the harm caused by traumatic experience** by examining and challenging unhelpful beliefs.

**How it works:**
- Identify "stuck points" (beliefs keeping you trapped)
- Examine evidence for and against these beliefs
- Develop more balanced, accurate thoughts
- Change how you relate to what happened

**Example stuck points:**
- "It was my fault" → "I did the best I could in an impossible situation"
- "I can't trust anyone" → "Some people are trustworthy; I can learn to recognize them"
- "I'm damaged forever" → "I was hurt, but I'm healing and growing"

**CPT helps you "rewire" how your brain reacts** to thoughts about the trauma.

**For many patients, CPT has helped them:**
- Move past stuck points
- Develop healthy coping skills
- Manage existing trauma
- Build resilience for the future

### EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)

**EMDR is a structured approach** that uses bilateral stimulation to help your brain process traumatic memories.

**What makes it different:**
- More structured than talk therapy
- Involves specific activities (eye movements, tapping, sounds)
- Helps resolve trauma without extensive verbal processing
- Works directly with how memories are stored

**The process:**
1. Identify traumatic memory
2. Notice body sensations and emotions
3. Follow bilateral stimulation (eye movements, tapping)
4. Allow brain to process and reprocess
5. Memory becomes less disturbing

**Benefits:**
- Don't have to describe trauma in detail
- Relatively quick (often 6-12 sessions)
- Addresses multiple traumas
- Strong research support

**EMDR is a form of neurophysiological therapy** that helps clients resolve issues without having to talk extensively about them.

---

### Somatic Therapy

**Trauma lives in your body**, and somatic therapy addresses this directly.

**Body-centered approaches include:**
- Noticing body sensations
- Releasing trapped tension
- Completing interrupted survival responses
- Restoring sense of safety in your body
- Grounding techniques

**Why this matters:**
Your body holds trauma even when your mind doesn't remember. Addressing the physical component is often essential for complete healing.

---

### Traditional Talk Therapy

**Sometimes you need to tell your story** and have it witnessed by someone who truly understands.

**Benefits:**
- Build relationship with therapist
- Feel heard and validated
- Make sense of what happened
- Explore emotions safely
- Gain insights and perspective

**Combined with other approaches**, talk therapy provides comprehensive support.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I know if I have trauma?

**Trauma is often followed by a series of symptoms:**
- Unwanted memories or flashbacks
- Avoidance of people or situations
- Mental and emotional distress
- Problems remembering the traumatic experience
- Feeling anger or irritability
- Negative self-image
- Difficulty trusting
- Feeling unsafe in the world
- Physical symptoms without clear cause

**If these symptoms are interfering with your life**, trauma therapy can help—whether you have a clear traumatic event in mind or not.

**You don't need a diagnosis** to deserve support.

---

### EMDR sounds interesting but I'm afraid of losing control. Is it right for me?

**This is a very common concern.**

**The truth about EMDR:**
- You remain fully in control throughout
- You can stop at any time
- You don't lose consciousness or awareness
- You won't be forced to confront anything you're not ready for
- Your therapist guides the process safely

**If you're experiencing trauma symptoms**, EMDR might be worth trying. EMDR is definitely not your normal talk therapy, but that's what makes it so effective.

**We would have a thorough conversation** about what it entails, answer all your questions, and you would make the decision when you feel ready.

### What can I do outside of therapy to help with my trauma?

**Our two main tips: Stay active and don't self-isolate.**

**Physical activity helps:**
- Working out
- Yoga
- Walking or hiking
- Dancing
- Martial arts
- Any movement that feels good

**Why it helps:**
- Releases endorphins
- Maintains physical health
- Releases trapped energy
- Reclaims your felt sense of safety in your body
- Reduces anxiety and depression

**Social connection helps:**
- Reach out to trusted friends
- Join support groups
- Engage in community
- Allow yourself to be supported
- Build safe relationships

**Other helpful practices:**
- Journaling
- Meditation or mindfulness
- Creative expression (art, music, writing)
- Time in nature
- Establishing routines
- Good sleep hygiene
- Limiting substances

---

### Do I have to talk about my trauma?

**Of course not.**

**While talking can be beneficial** to both yourself and your therapist (they get to know your story better), we understand that trauma is serious and we would never force you to discuss something you're not comfortable sharing.

**Some therapies (like EMDR and somatic therapy)** don't require detailed verbal processing.

**However, we also want to say this:** It can be incredibly empowering to own your story and reshape the narrative as you see fit. When you begin to talk about what happened to you (when and if you're ready), the trauma often loses some of its power over you, and you're able to resume control.

**You decide when and how much to share.** We meet you where you are.

---

### Will I ever "get over" my trauma?

**Trauma becomes part of your story**, but it doesn't have to define your story.

**Realistic goals:**
- Symptoms significantly decrease or resolve
- Triggers lose their power
- You can remember without reliving
- The past feels like the past
- You reclaim your life and joy
- You develop resilience and strength

**Complete erasure isn't usually the goal or realistic.** Instead, trauma becomes integrated—something that happened to you that you've learned from and healed from, rather than something that's actively harming you every day.

**Many trauma survivors report that healing:**
- Transformed them in positive ways
- Gave them strength they didn't know they had
- Deepened their compassion and empathy
- Clarified their values and priorities
- Connected them to meaning and purpose

**Trauma resolved truly can be a gift**—not because trauma is good, but because the healing journey reveals your resilience.

---

### How long does trauma therapy take?

**It varies significantly based on:**
- Type and severity of trauma
- How long ago it occurred
- Your support system
- Your readiness to engage
- The therapeutic approach used

**General timelines:**

**Single-incident trauma with EMDR:** Sometimes 6-12 sessions

**Complex trauma:** Often 1-2+ years of consistent work

**Ongoing support:** Some people benefit from long-term therapy

**There's no "right" timeline.** Healing happens at the pace it needs to happen.
