## What is Individual Therapy?

Individual therapy is professional one-on-one counseling where you work with a trained, licensed therapist to explore your thoughts, feelings, and life experiences in a safe, confidential space. It's sometimes called psychotherapy, talk therapy, or counseling—all terms for the same deeply personal process of healing and growth.

**The foundation of effective individual therapy rests on two essential elements:**

**First**, your willingness to challenge yourself and learn more about the roots of your symptoms and yourself in the process. Therapy works best when you're open to looking inward, even when it's uncomfortable. This doesn't mean you need to have everything figured out before you start—quite the opposite. It means showing up with curiosity about yourself and a willingness to explore.

**Second**, the therapeutic relationship itself. You're not just talking to anyone—you're having a dialogue with a trained professional who brings years of education, clinical experience, and specialized skills to support your healing. This combination of your courage and our expertise creates the conditions for real, lasting change.

**The ultimate goal** of individual therapy is to help you find greater self-awareness and equip you with practical tools to live a more meaningful, fulfilling life. Along the way, you'll better understand your patterns, develop healthier coping strategies, improve your relationships, and build resilience to face life's inevitable challenges.

## Self Exploration: The Beginning of Wisdom

The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle taught that "Knowing yourself is the beginning of all wisdom." We embrace this timeless truth in our therapeutic approach.

**We believe that any form of therapy is fundamentally a path to knowing yourself better**, with the ultimate goal of managing mental health challenges more effectively. When you understand why you think, feel, and behave the way you do, you gain the power to make different choices.

### Common Reasons People Seek Individual Therapy

You might be experiencing challenges that include (but certainly aren't limited to):

**Anxiety** - Persistent worry, panic attacks, social anxiety, phobias, or generalized anxiety that interferes with daily life

**Depression** - Ongoing sadness, loss of interest in things you once enjoyed, feelings of hopelessness, changes in sleep or appetite, or difficulty functioning

**Grief and Loss** - Processing the death of a loved one, the end of a relationship, job loss, or any significant life transition that leaves you feeling unmoored

**Anger** - Difficulty controlling your temper, explosive outbursts, resentment that won't fade, or anger that damages your relationships

**Low Self-Esteem** - Persistent negative self-talk, feelings of worthlessness, difficulty accepting compliments, or comparing yourself unfavorably to others

**Relationship Issues** - Patterns of conflict, difficulty with intimacy, trust issues, codependency, or struggles to maintain healthy boundaries

**Life Transitions** - Moving, career changes, becoming a parent, divorce, retirement, or any major life shift that feels overwhelming

**Trauma** - Past experiences that continue to affect you in the present, whether from childhood, recent events, or ongoing circumstances

**Stress Management** - Feeling overwhelmed by responsibilities, burned out, or unable to relax

**Identity Questions** - Exploring who you are, what you value, your sexual orientation, gender identity, or your place in the world

**Behavioral Concerns** - Habits you want to change, addictive patterns, procrastination, or behaviors that aren't serving you

**You might be asking yourself: "Can therapy really help me?"**

The answer is a resounding yes. Decades of research across thousands of studies confirm that therapy works. But beyond the statistics, we see the evidence in the real people who walk through our doors feeling stuck, overwhelmed, or lost—and who gradually find their way to a better place.

**Having someone to talk to who is unbiased and non-judgmental can be incredibly helpful on its own.** There's power in being truly heard without fear of criticism, without someone trying to fix you, and without the complications that come with talking to friends or family who have their own emotional investment in your choices.

Add to that the specialized knowledge, clinical training, and therapeutic skills your therapist brings to the table, and you have a powerful formula for change.

## SPOTLIGHT: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

One of the therapeutic methods we use frequently is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, commonly known as CBT. It's one of the most researched and evidence-based approaches in mental health treatment, with decades of scientific support demonstrating its effectiveness.

### What is CBT?

CBT is a structured, goal-oriented type of therapy that focuses on the powerful connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The core insight of CBT is deceptively simple but profoundly important: **the way you think about situations influences how you feel, and how you feel influences what you do**.

When negative or distorted thought patterns take hold (often operating beneath your conscious awareness), they create a cycle that reinforces emotional distress and unhelpful behaviors. CBT works by bringing these automatic thoughts into awareness, examining them, and learning to respond differently.

### How CBT Works: The Thought-Feeling-Behavior Connection

Let's break down how this works in real life:

**Situation** → Something happens (external event)  
**Thought** → You interpret the situation (often automatically)  
**Feeling** → Your interpretation creates an emotional response  
**Behavior** → Your emotion drives your action (or inaction)  
**Consequence** → Your behavior creates results that often reinforce the original thought

**Here's a concrete example many people experience:**

**Situation:** You send a text to a friend and don't get a response for several hours.

**Automatic Thought:** "They're ignoring me. They must be mad at me. Maybe they don't actually like me."

**Feeling:** Anxiety, hurt, rejection

**Behavior:** You either send multiple follow-up texts (appearing clingy) or withdraw and don't reach out again (appearing distant)

**Consequence:** The relationship becomes strained, which reinforces your belief that people don't really like you

**In CBT, we would examine this pattern together:**

**Reality Check:** Is it actually true that your friend is mad at you? Could there be other explanations? (They're busy, didn't see the text, fell asleep, etc.)

**Probability:** How often do your assumptions like this turn out to be accurate?

**Alternative Thoughts:** What are other ways to interpret this situation?

**Behavioral Experiment:** What happens if you respond differently?

Over time, you learn to catch these automatic thoughts, question them, and replace them with more balanced, realistic thinking. This doesn't mean fake positivity or pretending problems don't exist—it means seeing situations more clearly instead of through the distorted lens of anxiety, depression, or past wounds.

### A Deeper Example: The Public Speaking Phobia

Let's explore a more complex example to really illustrate how CBT works:

Imagine you have a crippling fear of public speaking. When faced with the possibility of presenting at work, here's what might happen:

**Your mind tells you:** "If I speak in public, I'll embarrass myself. My mind will go blank. Everyone will see how nervous I am and judge me. I'll lose respect from my colleagues. It's easier to just avoid public speaking entirely."

**What this creates:**
- Intense anxiety at even the thought of presenting
- Avoiding any situation that might involve public speaking
- Passing up career opportunities that require presentations
- Feeling ashamed of your fear
- Increasing isolation as the fear generalizes to other social situations

**The paradox:** By avoiding public speaking to avoid discomfort, you actually make the problem worse. The fear grows larger and more powerful. Your confidence erodes further. The gap between where you are and where you want to be widens.

**CBT seeks to break this cycle by helping you:**

**1. Identify your automatic thoughts**
"I'll embarrass myself" - Is this a fact or a prediction?
"Everyone will judge me" - Everyone? Really? And for how long?
"I can't handle the anxiety" - Have you ever handled anxiety before?

**2. Examine the evidence**
- Have you ever seen someone get nervous during a presentation? Did you judge them harshly or feel compassion?
- When you've felt anxious in the past, did you actually die or just feel uncomfortable?
- Can you remember any presentations that went better than you expected?

**3. Identify cognitive distortions**
- **All-or-nothing thinking:** "If I'm not perfect, I've failed"
- **Mind reading:** "I know everyone is judging me"
- **Catastrophizing:** "This will be a disaster"
- **Fortune telling:** "I know I'll mess up"

**4. Challenge distorted thoughts**
- What's the most realistic outcome (not best or worst case)?
- What would you tell a friend in this situation?
- Will this matter in a year? In five years?

**5. Develop alternative, balanced thoughts**
Replace: "I'll embarrass myself and everyone will judge me"
With: "I might feel nervous, and that's normal. Most people will be supportive or neutral. Even if I make a mistake, people forget faster than I think. I can handle being uncomfortable for a short time."

**6. Practice new behaviors (gradual exposure)**
- Start by speaking up in small meetings
- Practice your presentation with a supportive friend
- Give a low-stakes presentation to build confidence
- Gradually work up to more challenging situations

**7. Learn coping skills**
- Breathing techniques to manage physical anxiety
- Grounding exercises to stay present
- Realistic preparation (not over-preparing, which feeds anxiety)
- Self-compassion when things don't go perfectly

**The goal isn't to eliminate nervousness** (which is a normal, human response to being evaluated). The goal is to:
- See the situation more accurately instead of through the lens of catastrophe
- Tolerate discomfort without avoiding what matters to you
- Build confidence through successful experiences
- Develop a healthier relationship with anxiety

### What CBT Can Treat

CBT has strong research support for treating:
- Depression
- Anxiety disorders (GAD, social anxiety, panic disorder, specific phobias)
- OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder)
- PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)
- Eating disorders
- Insomnia
- Chronic pain (psychological components)
- Substance use disorders (as part of comprehensive treatment)
- Anger management
- Relationship issues

### The Structure of CBT

CBT tends to be:
- **Time-limited:** Often 12-20 sessions, though this varies based on your needs
- **Goal-oriented:** You and your therapist identify specific targets to work on
- **Skills-based:** You learn concrete tools you can use outside of sessions
- **Homework-involved:** Practice between sessions is essential for progress
- **Collaborative:** You and your therapist work as partners

This structured approach appeals to many people who want a clear roadmap and measurable progress.

### CBT Is Not...

**Just positive thinking** - It's about realistic thinking and seeing situations clearly

**A quick fix** - Real change takes practice and time

**Dismissive of your feelings** - Your emotions are valid; we're examining the thoughts that create them

**One-size-fits-all** - We adapt the approach to fit your specific needs and situation

## Frequently Asked Questions About Individual Therapy

### "Why would I want to talk to a therapist instead of a friend?"

This is one of the most common questions we hear, and it's completely understandable. Friends can be wonderful sources of support, and we absolutely don't discourage you from talking with people who love you.

**Here's what makes therapy different:**

**Therapists bring specialized training and clinical expertise.** We've spent years learning about how the mind works, what creates psychological distress, and which interventions actually help. Your friends, no matter how loving, typically haven't had this training.

**Therapy is completely unbiased.** Your therapist doesn't have a personal stake in the decisions you make. We won't be hurt if you decide to end a relationship, change jobs, or make other life changes. Friends, even with the best intentions, sometimes give advice based on what they would want or what would make their lives easier.

**Therapy is your space entirely.** You never have to worry about burdening your therapist or taking up too much time. You don't have to reciprocate or listen to our problems. It's one hour where everything is about you.

**Therapy is confidential.** You can say things you'd never say to anyone else without fear of judgment or the information spreading.

**Therapists are trained to hear what you're not saying.** We notice patterns, identify underlying issues, and gently point out contradictions or blind spots you might not see yourself.

**Many people thrive on both**—friends who love and cherish them AND a therapist who can provide professional guidance and support through mental health challenges. These aren't mutually exclusive; they're complementary.

### "How long do I have to be in therapy?"

**The short answer:** As long as it's helpful, which you get to decide.

**The longer answer:** Therapy is meant to work for you, so we accommodate whatever timeline and preferences you have. Some people come for a few months to work through a specific issue. Others stay for years as they work on deeper patterns. Some people cycle in and out—coming for support during difficult periods and taking breaks when life is stable.

**Factors that influence duration:**

**Your goals** - Want to learn coping skills for anxiety? Might take a few months. Want to fundamentally understand and change lifelong patterns? Takes longer.

**Severity and complexity** - A recent life stressor might resolve relatively quickly. Childhood trauma, complex PTSD, or deeply entrenched patterns take more time.

**Your commitment** - The more you engage with the process, practice skills between sessions, and apply insights to your life, the more efficient therapy becomes.

**The therapeutic relationship** - Sometimes it takes time to build enough trust to go deep.

**Life circumstances** - Sometimes life keeps throwing curveballs that need to be addressed.

**It's important to focus on this truth: YOU decide.** The process can be as flexible as you need it to be. You can:
- See us weekly for a few months, then stop when you feel better
- Continue weekly indefinitely if that supports your wellbeing
- Transition to every other week or monthly check-ins
- Take breaks and come back when needed
- End therapy at any time (ideally with a final session to process the ending, but it's your choice)

**Of course, the more you view therapy as a priority and commit yourself to the process, the quicker you'll likely see results.** But "quicker" doesn't always mean better. Sometimes slow, steady work creates more lasting change than rushing through.

---

### "How confidential is therapy really?"

Your privacy is not just important to us—it's a fundamental ethical and legal requirement of our profession.

**We adhere to strict confidentiality guidelines set forth by:**
- **HIPAA** (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) - Federal privacy law
- **APA** (American Psychological Association) - Professional ethics code
- **State licensing boards** - Additional state-specific protections

**What this means in practice:**
- We cannot confirm or deny to anyone that you're a client without your written permission
- We cannot share what you discuss in sessions
- Your records are stored securely and access is strictly limited
- We cannot discuss you with family members without your explicit consent

**However, there are specific legal and ethical limitations to confidentiality that we're required to disclose:**

**We MUST break confidentiality if:**

**1. You express credible intent to harm yourself (suicide risk)**
If we believe you're at imminent risk of suicide, we may need to take action to keep you safe, which could include:
- Contacting emergency services
- Calling a designated emergency contact
- Recommending hospitalization if the risk is severe

**2. You express credible intent to harm someone else**
If you make a specific, credible threat against an identifiable person, we have a "duty to warn" that person and notify authorities.

**3. We learn about child abuse or neglect**
If we have reason to believe a child is being abused or neglected, we're mandated reporters and must file a report with child protective services.

**4. We learn about elder or dependent adult abuse**
Similar to child abuse, we must report suspected abuse of vulnerable elderly or dependent adults.

**5. A court orders us to release information**
In rare cases, a judge can compel us to testify or release records (though we fight hard to protect your privacy even in legal situations).

**These exceptions exist to protect life and safety.** They're used rarely, and when they are necessary, we'll talk with you about it first whenever possible.

**Aside from these specific, legally mandated situations, everything you say in therapy is completely confidential and will remain entirely private.**

If you're in couples or family therapy, we discuss confidentiality boundaries at the start so everyone knows what to expect.

### "What actually happens in a counseling session?"

**The honest answer: Part of that is entirely up to you.**

**We want your session to be yours.** It's a dedicated space and time for you to talk about whatever's on your mind, explore whatever you're struggling with, and work toward whatever goals matter to you.

**That said, different therapists have different styles, and different therapeutic approaches follow different structures.** Some therapists are more directive and structured; others follow your lead more. Some use specific techniques or worksheets; others work primarily through conversation.

**When you first contact us, we'll learn about your preferences:**
- Do you want someone who provides clear structure and guidance?
- Do you prefer a therapist who uses a specific method (like CBT, EMDR, DBT)?
- Are there populations your therapist should have experience with (LGBTQ+ individuals, people of color, veterans, etc.)?
- Do you have any deal-breakers or strong preferences (male/female therapist, certain therapeutic style, etc.)?

**We'll make sure to pair you with a therapist who's the right fit for your needs and preferences.**

### What Your First Session Will Look Like

**Your first session (called an "intake" or "initial assessment") has some standard elements:**

**Paperwork and logistics**
- Consent forms, privacy policies, financial agreements
- Your therapist explaining how they work and what you can expect
- Discussion of goals and what brought you to therapy

**Getting to know you**
- Background information (family, relationships, work, medical history)
- Current concerns and symptoms
- What you've tried before and what's worked or hasn't
- Strengths and resources you have

**Beginning to build the therapeutic relationship**
- You getting a feel for your therapist's style
- Your therapist beginning to understand your unique situation
- Both of you assessing whether it feels like a good fit

**Initial treatment planning**
- Identifying goals for therapy
- Discussing frequency of sessions
- Talking about approaches that might help

**First sessions can feel a bit interview-like** as your therapist gathers information. This is normal and necessary. As therapy continues, sessions become much more conversational and focused on the work.

### What Ongoing Sessions Look Like

**After your initial session(s), a typical therapy session might unfold like this:**

**Check-in** (5-10 minutes)
- How have you been since last session?
- Any new developments, crises, or wins to address?
- Review any homework or practice from last week

**Main work** (35-45 minutes)
This is where the heart of therapy happens, and it varies widely depending on:
- Your therapist's approach
- What you're working on
- What's most pressing that day
- The stage of therapy you're in

**This might include:**
- Exploring a specific issue or pattern
- Processing difficult emotions or experiences
- Learning and practicing new coping skills
- Examining your thoughts and their impact
- Discussing relationships or recent conflicts
- Processing trauma (if that's your goal)
- Practicing communication skills through role-play
- Completing specific therapeutic exercises

**Wrap-up** (5-10 minutes)
- Summarizing key insights or themes
- Identifying anything to work on before next session
- Planning between-session practice or homework
- Scheduling your next appointment

**Usually, your therapist will have some game plan for the session based on your treatment goals**, but we're also completely flexible to tackle anything that comes up organically. If you arrive at your session in crisis or with something urgent on your mind, we address that. The plan serves the process, not the other way around.

### A Helpful Metaphor: You and Your Therapist as Train Conductors

You can think of the role of the therapist like a conductor on a train. Throughout treatment, you and your therapist are faced with several dark tunnels—each representing a different area of your life or aspect of yourself to explore.

**You decide which tunnel you'd like to explore.** Your therapist helps drive the train safely through that tunnel, pointing out things you might not notice, helping you navigate obstacles, and supporting you when it gets dark or scary.

**At any point, if you decide you want to try a different tunnel, you can turn around together and try again.** The journey is collaborative, with you steering the overall direction and your therapist providing expertise, support, and guidance along the way.

## Is Individual Therapy Right for You?

**You might benefit from individual therapy if:**

- You're struggling with emotions that feel overwhelming or unmanageable
- You keep repeating the same patterns and want to understand why
- You've experienced trauma that continues to affect your daily life
- You're going through a major life transition
- Your relationships are strained or unsatisfying
- You want to understand yourself more deeply
- You feel stuck and don't know how to move forward
- You're functioning but not thriving
- You want professional support to achieve personal goals

**You DON'T need to be "sick enough" or "broken enough" to deserve therapy.** You don't need to be in crisis. Many people come to therapy because they want to grow, not just because they're struggling.

**You're ready for therapy when you're willing to:**
- Show up consistently (even when it's hard)
- Be honest (even when it's uncomfortable)
- Look at yourself with curiosity rather than just judgment
- Practice new skills outside of sessions
- Trust the process even when progress feels slow
