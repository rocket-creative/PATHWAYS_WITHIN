## Understanding the Teen Years

Do you or your teen need someone to talk to but you're not sure where or how to begin?

**Teens reign supreme in the realm of "I don't want to talk about it"—and with good reason.** The cognitive and emotional development that takes place during the teen years is profound. You're moving from voicelessness to independence within a complicated world that's constantly changing around you. Your brain is literally rewiring itself, your body is transforming, your social world is expanding, and you're trying to figure out who you are while everyone around you has opinions about who you should be.

**It's hard to know how to process what you're feeling while you're feeling it**, much less put it into words so someone else can understand. And honestly? You shouldn't have to have it all figured out. That's an unrealistic expectation.

**Here's what we understand:** It's not that teens don't want to be understood or feel above relating to their parents and loved ones. **You're trying to understand yourself first.** We're here to support that effort, not replace it or undermine it.

## What Changes During the Teen Years

**The teenage years involve massive changes across every dimension of your life:**

### Social Changes
- **Exposure** to new ideas, people, and experiences
- **Independence** as you separate from family and build your own identity
- **Identity formation** (Who am I? What do I value? What do I believe?)
- **Influences** from peers, media, culture pulling you in different directions
- **Relationships** becoming more complex (romantic, platonic, familial)
- **Responsibility** increasing at school, home, work
- **Values** being questioned and redefined

### Emotional Changes
- **Decision making** as your brain develops executive function
- **Feelings** becoming more intense and complicated
- **Moods** that can shift rapidly
- **Peer response** mattering intensely (sometimes more than family)
- **Perception** of yourself and others evolving
- **Sensitivity** to criticism, rejection, or being misunderstood
- **Self consciousness** about appearance, performance, belonging

**A comfortable, safe therapeutic relationship can help you make sense of this kaleidoscope of experiences that can make being a teenager feel tumultuous, overwhelming, or just plain exhausting.**

## FOR TEENS: This Section Is For You

Are you feeling hopeless, helpless, frustrated, or just overwhelmed? Are you experiencing something and you're just not sure where to turn or how to process it?

**We're here for you.**

Growing up is complicated, and **no one here is going to tell you it's "normal" or that you're being too "emo" or "angsty."** The truth is, you're not. You're going through a lot—real, significant challenges—and there is nothing wrong with asking for help to make sure you can navigate this safely.

**Your mental health matters.** We value your autonomy in advocating for it and your privacy in talking about the things that matter to you.

**You don't need permission to feel what you feel.** You don't need to justify your struggles or prove they're "bad enough" to deserve support. If you're hurting, that's enough.

### What to Expect in Therapy

**Therapy isn't like talking to your parents or teachers.** Your therapist:
- Won't lecture you or tell you what to do
- Won't judge your choices or feelings
- Won't share what you talk about with your parents (with specific safety exceptions)
- Won't act like they have all the answers

**Instead, we'll:**
- Listen without judgment
- Help you understand yourself better
- Teach you actual skills to manage stress, anxiety, depression, or whatever you're dealing with
- Respect your privacy and autonomy
- Take you seriously

**Therapy is your space.** You get to decide what to talk about. You can be honest about things you can't say anywhere else. You can explore who you are without someone trying to shape you into who they want you to be.

### The Places We Can Help

**School**  
School stress is real and overwhelming. Balancing academic demands with your growing independence and developing responsibilities outside of school creates immense pressure. Add in college applications, testing, GPAs, and everyone's expectations—it's a lot.

**We can help you:**
- Manage academic anxiety and test stress
- Navigate school social dynamics
- Address perfectionism and fear of failure
- Cope with learning challenges
- Deal with teacher or authority conflicts

**Family**  
The shape of relationships at home changes during the teen years. You're figuring out how to love your family while celebrating your growing independence, which can create tension and misunderstanding.

**We can help you:**
- Communicate with parents more effectively
- Navigate family conflict
- Process divorce, separation, or blended family issues
- Deal with family expectations vs. your own wants
- Understand your feelings about family dynamics

**Social**  
Friends, peers, social groups, clubs, online communities—it's a lot to sort out. You're figuring out where you fit, where you want to fit, and how to prioritize the people around you while staying true to yourself.

**We can help you:**
- Navigate friendship drama and betrayals
- Deal with bullying or social exclusion
- Understand romantic relationships
- Build confidence in social situations
- Set boundaries with peers
- Manage social media stress

### The Experiences We Can Support

**Trauma**  
If you've been through something that's sticking with you and affecting your ability to heal or move forward, you are not alone. There are proven tools and therapies that support healing from all types of trauma.

**Abuse**  
Have you experienced physical, emotional, or sexual abuse? After the initial shock of what you've been through, you may be ready to move on but don't know how. We want to help you take your life back and heal at your own pace.

**Mental Health**  
Depression, anxiety, panic attacks, OCD, eating disorders, self harm, suicidal thoughts—these aren't character flaws or signs of weakness. They're mental health challenges that respond to treatment.

**Identity and Belonging**  
Figuring out your sexual orientation, gender identity, or just who you are as a person can bring up intense feelings—especially if you don't feel supported or understood.

**Health**  
Your whole self health (physical and mental) impacts how you experience daily life. Whether you're struggling with chronic illness, body image issues, or mental health concerns, you deserve to feel empowered in your own body.

### What Actually Happens in Teen Therapy

**In therapy sessions, you might:**

**Talk about what's bothering you**  
It's easier to feel your feelings one at a time when you don't have to keep them all bottled up inside. Sometimes just saying things out loud to someone who won't judge you makes a huge difference.

**Learn new things about yourself**  
Understanding why you react certain ways or what triggers specific feelings gives you power. When you understand yourself better, you can make choices that actually serve you.

**Practice real skills**  
Mindfulness, grounding techniques, breathing exercises, self talk strategies, communication skills—these are tools no one can see you using or stop you from accessing. They're yours to keep forever.

**Find your strengths**  
Therapy isn't just about fixing problems. It's also about discovering what you're good at and building confidence in who you are and what you want to achieve, even when things feel hard.

**Process difficult experiences**  
Trauma, loss, betrayal, rejection—these things don't just go away if you ignore them. Therapy gives you a safe place to work through them so they don't control your life.

### What You Can Do at Home

**Prepare for growth**  
As you find a safe space to relax and get support in therapy, you'll naturally start changing. This is good, but it can feel weird. Be patient with yourself.

**Practice the skills**  
Your therapist will teach you techniques to use outside of sessions. Actually using them (even when it feels awkward at first) is how they become automatic.

**Lean on support**  
You don't have to do this alone. Parents, teachers, coaches, other trusted adults—it's okay to let people help you.

**Take care of your body**  
Stay hydrated, eat regularly, move your body, get sleep. These things directly affect your mental health, even when it doesn't feel connected.

**Care for your mind**  
Practice self compassion. Talk to yourself like you'd talk to a friend. Find at least one person you can be real with about how you're feeling.

### Your Privacy Matters

**What you say in therapy is confidential.** Your therapist won't share details with your parents unless:
- You're at risk of harming yourself
- Someone is harming you
- You plan to harm someone else

**Outside these safety situations, what happens in therapy stays in therapy.** Your parents might get general updates ("working on anxiety management skills"), but not specifics about what you talked about.

**You have a right to privacy,** even as a teenager. We respect that.

### If You're in Crisis Right Now

**If you're feeling overwhelmed and fear you may be at risk of harm from yourself or anyone else, please don't wait for an appointment.**

**Call or text 988** - Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (24/7, free, confidential)  
**Text "HELLO" to 741741** - Crisis Text Line (24/7)  
**Call 911** - If you're in immediate danger

**You deserve help. You deserve to feel better. We're here when you're ready.**

## FOR PARENTS: Supporting Your Teen

Therapy can help your teen navigate the immense pressures of a constantly changing social and emotional landscape during this transitional time.

**Whether your teen has experienced something beyond your expertise as a parent or is simply having difficulty processing the changes they're going through, they deserve support.**

### Why Therapy for Teens is Different

**Teens are not big kids and they're not young adults.** They're in a unique developmental stage that requires specialized understanding:

**Developmentally**, teens are:
- Experiencing dramatic brain changes (prefrontal cortex still developing)
- Driven by emotion more than logic (amygdala is overactive)
- Biologically wired to take risks and seek independence
- Extremely sensitive to peer judgment and social status
- Forming their identity separately from family

**This means:**
- They're not being difficult on purpose—their brains are literally under construction
- What looks like rebellion is often a necessary part of individuation
- Emotional intensity is neurological, not manipulation
- Peer relationships genuinely matter as much (or more) than family relationships right now

**Understanding this helps you respond with compassion instead of frustration.**

### Offering Empathetic, Judgment Free Support

**Opening the door for hard conversations is one of the best things you can do for your teen.** But what happens when you're having those conversations and you're not sure what to do with what you learn? Or when your teen won't talk to you at all?

**This is where therapy comes in.**

**Therapeutic support for your teen is a tool to support your conversations, not replace them.** It's as much a parenting resource for you as it is healing work for them.

### What Therapy Offers Your Teen

**A safe space to explore identity** without worrying about disappointing you

**Professional support for challenges** you may not have expertise in (trauma, mental health, peer pressure, identity questions)

**Skills they'll use for life** (emotional regulation, communication, coping strategies)

**Validation of their experiences** from someone outside the family system

**Privacy and autonomy** which builds trust and self advocacy skills

**Someone who's just for them** in a life where everyone else has agendas

### What Therapy Offers You as a Parent

**Insight into what your teen is experiencing** (without violating their privacy)

**Strategies for communicating more effectively** with your teen

**Support in navigating your own feelings** about your teen's struggles

**Expert guidance** on when to worry and when to give space

**Relief** from carrying everything alone

### Navigating the Privacy Balance

**This is often the hardest part for parents:** Your teen's therapist will NOT tell you everything that happens in sessions.

**Why?** Because therapy only works if your teen trusts that it's a confidential space. If they think everything they say will be reported to you, they won't be honest, and therapy won't be effective.

**What you will get:**
- General updates on progress and themes
- Guidance on supporting your teen at home
- Alerts about safety concerns
- Collaboration on treatment goals

**What you won't get:**
- Details about specific conversations
- Private thoughts your teen shared
- Information that would break their trust

**This is hard, but it's necessary. Trust the process and trust your teen's therapist to involve you appropriately.**

### When to Seek Therapy for Your Teen

**You might consider therapy if your teen:**
- Seems persistently sad, anxious, or angry
- Has withdrawn from activities they used to enjoy
- Is isolating from friends or family
- Shows dramatic changes in eating or sleeping
- Is self harming or talking about death/suicide
- Has experienced trauma, abuse, or major loss
- Is struggling academically when they didn't before
- Has intense mood swings beyond normal teenage volatility
- Is engaging in risky behaviors (substance use, unsafe sex, etc.)
- Experienced a major life change (divorce, move, etc.)
- Just seems "off" in ways you can't quite name

**You don't need a crisis to seek therapy.** Proactive support prevents crises.

### Supporting Your Teen in Therapy

**Respect their privacy** - Don't demand details about sessions

**Attend your own therapy if needed** - Working on yourself helps your relationship with your teen

**Follow through on recommendations** - If the therapist suggests family therapy or changes at home, seriously consider them

**Be patient** - Change takes time, and teens may get worse before they get better as they start processing difficult feelings

**Don't use therapy as punishment** - "Keep acting like this and you'll have to talk to your therapist about it" undermines the therapeutic relationship

**Normalize mental health care** - Talk about therapy as healthy self care, not shameful treatment

**Take care of yourself** - Parenting a struggling teen is exhausting and heartbreaking. You need support too.

### What If My Teen Doesn't Want to Go?

**Some resistance is normal,** especially at first. Teens might resist because:
- They don't think anything is wrong
- They're worried about being judged
- They don't trust that it's actually private
- Change feels scary
- They resent being "made" to go

**How to help:**
- Explain why you think it would be helpful (specific, not "you're a mess")
- Emphasize that it's their space and their choice what to talk about
- Normalize therapy ("lots of people see therapists, including adults")
- Offer choice in therapist gender, approach, or location
- Give it a few sessions before deciding it's not working

**Most teens who initially resist warm up once they meet their therapist and realize it's not what they feared.**
