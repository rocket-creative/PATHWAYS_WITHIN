## Why Couples Seek Therapy

Relationships can be difficult to maintain, especially as the years go by and each person changes in unforeseen ways. **A break in communication can often lead to other problems** that plague modern partnerships, and therapy can be a powerful way to uncover the underlying issues in order to build stronger connections with your partner.

### Do any of these feel familiar?

**Wondering why you haven't found the love you want** in your relationship, even though you're together?

**Feeling like love fades** the longer you've been together, and you don't know how to get that spark back?

**Believing that no matter what you say or do** for your significant other, it's never the "right thing" or "good enough"?

**Finding yourself in the aftermath of a betrayal** in one way or another—infidelity, broken trust, lies, or emotional affairs?

**Feeling more like roommates** than romantic partners?

**Fighting about the same things** over and over without resolution?

**Avoiding each other** to prevent conflict, but feeling lonelier because of it?

**These are common experiences in long term relationships.** You're not alone, and more importantly, these patterns can change. Couples therapy can help.

## Couples Therapy in a Nutshell

### The Natural Ebb and Flow

In a long partnership, **people tend to drift apart.** This is actually a natural ebb and flow of relationships, and there's nothing inherently wrong with your relationship if you feel this way. Life gets busy, stress accumulates, patterns develop, and before you know it, you're living parallel lives instead of an intertwined one.

**The challenge isn't that you've drifted—it's whether you can pull yourselves back together** and rediscover what drew you to your partner in the first place.

### It's Not About Airing Dirty Laundry

To some couples, it might feel uncomfortable to "air out your dirty laundry" in front of another person. **We want you to know that's not how it feels from our side.** We don't see your struggles as shameful secrets. We see two people who care enough about their relationship to fight for it.

**We're there simply to help communication flow more easily**, to serve as a neutral middle ground for each partner. **The connection is already there between you**—we're just there to help you remember what it is and how to tap into it again.

---

## Comfort is Key

One of the most important parts of couples therapy is **feeling comfortable**—both with the idea of attending therapy and with your therapist.

### When One Partner is Hesitant

**Usually, one partner is much more convinced about the benefits of therapy than the other.** This is completely normal. In these cases, it's important for the more enthusiastic partner to show gratitude that the hesitant partner is giving therapy a try. That willingness to show up, even with skepticism, is an act of love.

**For the hesitant partner:** We get it. You might feel like therapy means your relationship is failing, or that the therapist will gang up on you with your partner, or that this is all a waste of time. Give it a few sessions. Most initially skeptical partners are surprised by how helpful it actually is.

### Your Therapist Won't Take Sides

**It's crucial to know that your therapist is not going to take sides** regarding whatever conflict you bring in—no matter their gender, relationship status, or personal history.

**The role of the therapist is NOT to:**
- Declare one partner "right" and the other "wrong"
- Choose who to believe when stories conflict
- Team up with one partner against the other
- Decide whether you should stay together or break up

**The role of the therapist IS to:**
- Help you hear each other without defensiveness
- Help you truly see each other's perspective
- Identify unhealthy patterns you might not notice
- Teach communication skills that actually work
- Create a safe space for difficult conversations
- Guide you toward understanding and empathy

### Finding the Right Fit

**We want you to feel comfortable working with your specific therapist.** Ideally, both you and your partner will feel comfortable sharing openly under your therapist's guidance.

**But if something makes you uncomfortable**, the best way to address it is to bring it up with your therapist. Maybe you'd prefer a therapist of a different gender, a different communication style, or a different approach. A good therapist welcomes this feedback and will either adjust or help you find a better match.

**We're flexible and open to our clients' needs** because therapy only works when you feel safe and respected.

## SPOTLIGHT: The Gottman Method

While couples therapy can take many forms, **we specialize in the Gottman Method**—one of the most researched and effective approaches to couples therapy available.

### What is the Gottman Method?

The Gottman Method is based on over 40 years of research by Drs. John and Julie Gottman, who studied thousands of couples to identify what makes relationships succeed or fail.

**The main idea:** Give priority to unresolved conflicts and work through them using positive communication strategies while building friendship, intimacy, and shared meaning.

### The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

One of the most powerful insights from Gottman research is the identification of **four communication patterns that predict relationship failure** with startling accuracy. These are called "The Four Horsemen":

**1. Criticism**  
Attacking your partner's character rather than addressing a specific behavior.
- Example: "You never help around the house because you're lazy and selfish" (criticism)
- vs. "I feel overwhelmed when I'm doing all the housework. Can we figure out a better system?" (complaint)

**2. Contempt**  
Treating your partner with disrespect, mockery, sarcasm, or superiority.
- Example: Eye rolling, name calling, mocking tone, belittling
- **Contempt is the single biggest predictor of divorce** because it communicates disgust and superiority

**3. Defensiveness**  
Making excuses, deflecting blame, or playing the victim instead of taking responsibility.
- Example: "Well I wouldn't yell if you didn't nag me all the time!"
- Defensiveness escalates conflict because it denies your partner's concerns

**4. Stonewalling**  
Shutting down, withdrawing, giving the silent treatment, or emotionally checking out.
- Example: Walking away mid conversation, refusing to respond, tuning out
- Usually happens when someone feels emotionally flooded and overwhelmed

**Over the course of therapy, you'll become familiar with these patterns** in your own relationship and learn concrete strategies to replace them with healthier communication.

### The Antidotes: What Works Instead

For each "Horsemen," there's an antidote:

**Antidote to Criticism: Gentle Start Up**
- Start conversations softly, without blame
- Use "I" statements about your feelings and needs
- Be specific about behaviors, not character attacks

**Antidote to Contempt: Build Culture of Appreciation**
- Deliberately notice what your partner does right
- Express genuine appreciation and respect
- Remember why you fell in love with them

**Antidote to Defensiveness: Take Responsibility**
- Accept your role in problems, even if partial
- Apologize genuinely when you've messed up
- Listen to understand, not to defend

**Antidote to Stonewalling: Self Soothing**
- Take breaks when emotionally flooded (but commit to returning)
- Use calming techniques (breathing, walking, etc.)
- Come back to the conversation when regulated

### Building Friendship and Intimacy

The Gottman Method isn't just about conflict—it's about **building a foundation of friendship, respect, and shared meaning.**

**You'll work on:**
- **Love Maps:** Knowing each other's inner world (dreams, fears, hopes, history)
- **Fondness and Admiration:** Actively appreciating each other
- **Turning Toward:** Responding to bids for connection instead of ignoring them
- **Positive Perspective:** Seeing your partner and relationship through a positive lens
- **Managing Conflict:** Not avoiding it, but handling it constructively
- **Creating Shared Meaning:** Building a life together that reflects both partners' values

### Why the Gottman Method Works

**The Gottman Method has been incredibly effective** in increasing respect, intimacy, and affection in couples. By removing barriers to conflict resolution and actively building friendship, couples who embrace this method can create **profound empathy and understanding** in their relationship—enough to sustain them for years to come.

## SPOTLIGHT: Somatic Couples Therapy

We also offer **a modified version of Somatic Therapy for couples**, which enhances the mind body connection within the context of your relationship.

### What is Somatic Couples Therapy?

**Somatic couples therapy recognizes that relationship distress lives not just in your thoughts and words, but in your bodies.**

When you fight with your partner, notice what happens physically:
- Your heart rate increases
- Your muscles tense
- Your breathing becomes shallow
- You might feel nauseous or get a headache
- You might feel the urge to flee or fight

**These physical responses affect how you communicate and connect.** When your nervous system is activated (fight, flight, or freeze), you literally can't access the rational, empathetic parts of your brain.

### How It Helps

**Somatic couples therapy teaches you to:**
- **Notice** your body's signals during conflict
- **Regulate** your nervous system before trying to resolve issues
- **Recognize** your partner's physical stress signals
- **Create** physical safety and calm in your relationship
- **Use** body based techniques to reconnect (safe touch, synchronized breathing, grounding)

**This is particularly helpful for couples who:**
- Have trauma histories affecting intimacy
- Experience intense physical reactions during fights
- Struggle with disconnection or lack of physical affection
- Want to deepen emotional and physical intimacy

## Frequently Asked Questions About Couples Therapy

### "What does a therapist know about my relationship?"

**This is actually a great question** because the benefit of having a therapist for couples therapy is precisely that **they're unbiased strangers.**

**Your therapist isn't involved in your lives**, so they can take a non judgmental approach to help you see patterns that might be invisible to you. Many people in long term relationships don't even realize the things they're doing that hurt their partner. **A trained third party observer can spot these moments and gently bring awareness to them.**

Your therapist brings:
- Clinical training in relationship dynamics
- Experience with hundreds of couples facing similar challenges
- Research based knowledge of what works and what doesn't
- The ability to see your relationship system objectively
- Skills to create safety for difficult conversations

---

### "What is the goal of couples therapy?"

**Couples therapy, like individual therapy, is highly personalized.** Each couple is unique, and therapy reflects that.

**Furthermore, the goal of therapy is to meet YOUR needs and preferences.** In couples therapy, there are two people involved, which means two sets of needs. Your therapist will do their best to honor both partners and give you both space to express your goals.

**Couples come to therapy with different goals:**

**Staying together and strengthening the relationship**
- Improving communication
- Rebuilding trust after betrayal
- Reigniting passion and intimacy
- Breaking destructive patterns
- Preparing for marriage or commitment

**Separating gracefully and minimizing harm**
- Co parenting effectively after divorce
- Untangling lives with respect
- Understanding what went wrong
- Healing enough to move forward

**Establishing solid footing for a newer relationship**
- Premarital counseling
- Blending families successfully
- Addressing concerns before they become crises
- Building healthy patterns from the start

**Your therapist helps you work toward YOUR goals**, whatever they are.

### "Why shouldn't I just end the relationship and start fresh?"

**Some couples feel that if they can't solve their problems on their own, they aren't right for each other.** Breaking up and starting over seems like the easier path.

**Unfortunately, this often isn't true. Here's why:**

**People bring the same patterns and habits into new relationships.** If you struggle with defensiveness, avoiding conflict, poor boundaries, trust issues, or communication problems—those don't disappear when the relationship ends. You carry them into the next one.

**Couples therapy is often more about learning about yourself** so you can be a better partner in THIS relationship (and any future relationship, if this one ends).

**Common patterns people repeat across relationships:**
- Choosing emotionally unavailable partners
- Avoiding conflict until resentment explodes
- Being controlling or jealous
- Sacrificing yourself and then feeling resentful
- Criticizing instead of expressing needs
- Withdrawing when things get hard

**Working through challenges in your current relationship** teaches you skills and self awareness you'll use forever. Even if you ultimately decide to separate, you'll leave with valuable insights.

**The goal of couples therapy is NOT to make a judgment about whether you should stay together.** It's to help you understand each other and your relationship from a different perspective so you can make informed decisions about your future.

---

### "What results can we expect from couples therapy?"

**We cannot guarantee your relationship will continue in the way you hope.** Therapy can't save every relationship, and sometimes the healthiest outcome is an amicable separation.

**What we CAN assure you:**

**By the end of your therapeutic journey, you will have:**
- A much better understanding of your relationship dynamics
- Deeper understanding of yourself as a partner
- Improved communication skills you can use anywhere
- Greater empathy for your partner's experience
- Clarity about what you need in a relationship
- Tools to manage conflict more effectively

**If both partners are willing and open to the work:**
- You'll become a source of comfort and support for each other
- You'll have tools to navigate future challenges
- You'll feel more connected and understood
- You'll break destructive patterns that were hurting you both

**The outcomes depend heavily on:**
- Both partners' commitment to the process
- Willingness to be vulnerable and honest
- Capacity to take responsibility for your own part
- Consistent attendance and practice of new skills
- Whether the relationship has a foundation worth building on

**Therapy creates the conditions for change. You do the changing.**

## What to Expect in Couples Therapy

### First Session: Assessment and Goals

**Your first session typically involves:**
- Both partners sharing their perspective on the relationship
- Identifying the main concerns and challenges
- Discussing relationship history (how you met, what attracted you, when problems started)
- Setting initial goals for therapy
- The therapist assessing patterns and dynamics
- Establishing ground rules for sessions

**This session can feel a bit tense**—you're discussing problems with a stranger present. That's normal.

### Ongoing Sessions: The Work

**Subsequent sessions might include:**
- Learning and practicing new communication skills
- Processing past hurts or betrayals
- Identifying and interrupting negative patterns
- Building appreciation and fondness
- Addressing specific conflicts or decisions
- Homework to practice between sessions
- Individual sessions occasionally (if therapeutically beneficial)

**Sessions are usually weekly** initially, then may shift to biweekly as you make progress.

### How Long Does It Take?

**Duration varies significantly:**
- Some couples see improvement in 8-12 sessions
- Others benefit from 6 months to a year of work
- Some couples return periodically for "tune ups" over the years

**It depends on:**
- Severity of issues
- Both partners' commitment
- How long patterns have been established
- Whether there's ongoing crisis (infidelity, substance use, etc.)

## Making the Most of Couples Therapy

**Both partners should:**

**Come with realistic expectations** - Therapy takes time and effort

**Be honest** - Your therapist can only help with what they know about

**Take responsibility** - Focus on your role, not just your partner's

**Do the homework** - Practicing new skills between sessions is essential

**Attend consistently** - Missing sessions slows progress

**Be patient** - Change doesn't happen overnight, and there may be setbacks

**Stay committed to the process** - Even when it's uncomfortable

**The couples who benefit most** are those where both partners are willing to look at themselves honestly and make changes, not just those trying to change their partner.
